Think tortilla, it works because its so thin, basically its all outside so heat does its job. For bread, you have a lot unfermented wet flour on the inside that doesnt heat up as much. More yeast doesnt rise up much more, but more sticky dough. Interior is a wee bit fluffier. But way more flavor with more yeast. Makes bread more sour, so good if you like sourdough. Too much yeast will weaken gluten and cause too much gas, bread will puff up and collapse. But this is good for flatbread, e.g. pizza dough. Too much yeast is bad for thin crust, as it weakens gluten and the dough will rip when streched. Just add more dough though and make it thick crust.\"));\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;","outboundReferences":[],"inboundReferences":[]},"fields":{"slug":"/Cooking/Pizza Dough","title":"Pizza Dough"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"25c3d435-a56e-52c4-be17-3650c2541c7b"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2098632890","2221750479","2468095761"]}
