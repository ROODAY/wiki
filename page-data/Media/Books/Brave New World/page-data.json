I don't really agree with the eugenics and caste system, but the book tries to argue that in this society everyone is happy with their station because it's all they've known, and is all their capable of knowing. My immediate reaction was that it's inhuman to create a lower caste of humans that are dumber and subservient, but then what if we do this robots and artificial intelligences? Is it not inhumane to shackle them to menial jobs too? How do we automate our world without oppression? I'm sure there's some middle ground here that doesn't involve essentially enslaving people, but it just made me think. Artificial people would be people too in my book.\"), mdx(\"li\", {\n    parentName: \"ul\"\n  }, \"This happens somewhere in the middle, but the story about the girl who got stuck with the savages and forced to raise a child made me really sad, how she was abused by the people because she didn't understand their way of life, and how she passed that abuse onto her son.

It's interesting to see John (the savage) being the stand in for our society and how he reacts to the society in the book.  I guess it raises interesting questions on what kind of happiness is morally superior, what we strive for in our world or how they do it in the book (just have sex with everybody and take drugs to feel good). At least so far in the book, there doesn't seem to be any issues with their society, everyone enjoys themselves.

They claim that every class is happy with their station as that's all they're capable of knowing, and that seems to be the case in the book, although they never show the POV of a lower caste character (the show does and postulates that they don't like their station/want to be alphas). I think such a utopia could work if everyone was the same, e.g. if everyone was an alpha, and all the menial labor/maintenance was taken care of by non-sentient robots (I believe any being capable of sentience, including artificial or non-human beings, deserve the same rights as we do). If no one was being oppressed in order to give alphas their lifestyle, I see nothing wrong with a life where you're always happy and just having sex all the time, as long as there was a place for people to pursue fulfillment (arts, science, other work, etc.).\", mdx(\"ul\", {\n    parentName: \"li\"\n  }, mdx(\"li\", {\n    parentName: \"ul\"\n  }, \"As a sub note, I think polyamory without attachments seems superior, as you won't ever have to deal with jealousy.

I think this is one of the few times that a TV show absolutely blows the source material out of the water. It took all the important themes from the book and expanded on them and made them relatable for a modern audience. It explored the relationships between characters and developed them far more, whereas the book just said that they had relationships. Everything in the show just felt more earned, and the visuals and music were stunning. The set design, costuming, lightning. VFX, worldbuilding, acting, soundtrack/score, EVERYTHING WAS SOOO GOOD!

Instead of quoting Shakespeare all the time and failing to integrate, he's just a normal guy who's had a hard life, and he integrates pretty well but just feels empty as he's used to feeling the full range of emotions that humans do. Like Bernard he also just wanted to be loved, but people kept seeing him as an object rather than a person and he still felt alone.
