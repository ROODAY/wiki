Typically the backlog is ordered by priority, so things at the top are higher priority, this makes it easier to pick tasks off the backlog when you have extra time, as they're already sorted for you (this prioritization of the backlog, typically called grooming the backlog, can be done in between sprints, but doesn't necessarily have to be).\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"And then you rinse and repeat.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"The idea here is that you can make constant progress over time as progress will be made during each sprint.
