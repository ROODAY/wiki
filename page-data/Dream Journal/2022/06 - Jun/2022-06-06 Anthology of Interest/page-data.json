The water looked more black than blue, the sky was full of stars and the moon was full and bright. Oh, and Predators, like the aliens, were hunting me. I was running between the islands through shallow water (so I guess it was more like one big island that was partially flooded), and the Predators would come up from below and attack me, and I'd somehow slap a sticky bomb on them and wriggle free so I could detonate them. I guess they must've been unblooded scrubs since I was dispatching them so handily. But eventually I ran out of bombs, and I called in to someone asking for more.
