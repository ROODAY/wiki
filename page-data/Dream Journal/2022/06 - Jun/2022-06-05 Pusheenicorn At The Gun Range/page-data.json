As context, I was following the advice of a friend who said that we should all get guns and learn how to use them safely, to defend ourselves from the nutjobs because gun control won't stop them from getting guns (I don't actually agree with this IRL, but dream me seemed to go along with it). The twist was that I was going with a group of said nutjobs, in my dream they were far right Republicans, and I had to pretend to be one of them so as not to blow cover.

I think they found me suspicious, and because of this so did the rest of the group I was with.

I was part of a squad that was moving a payload down the street, like in TF2 or Overwatch, except the street was straight, and I couldn't tell who the enemies were. Laser blasts were just coming in from all directions from the smoke, but I wasn't getting hurt.
