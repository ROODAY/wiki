The image that I have in my head is the inside of some large building, I think the architecture style would be brutalist?

Alas, my gold coin form wasn't fast enough and she beat me to it, and the power I sensed was the corpse of a dragon (how it got there or how it died, I don't know) and the witch absorbed the latent power from the corpse.
