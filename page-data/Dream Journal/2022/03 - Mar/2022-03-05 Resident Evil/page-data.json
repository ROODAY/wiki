The movie began with a steady pan down a damaged city street, perhaps in NYC. It looked like something large had crashed through the street, and indeed the camera lands on a black cargo plane's wreckage, still smoking.

These views show up as a grid so I can see all of them at once, and then the camera zooms into one of these views of a kid being attacked by some red tendril, and then zooming into further into someone's bloodstream (not sure if it was the tendril or the kid). The camera was now in some sort of artery or blood vessel (I could see the walls of the artery surrounding the periphery) and up ahead was T-junction with another artery. A white centipede like creature rushed passed the junction, in and out of view. Then the camera slowly zoomed out a bit so that it was no longer in the artery, but could see a network of arteries and blood vessels, and out of these the title card of \\\"Resident Evil\\\" came into view, as if the letters were made out of the same material.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Despite it never being said outright, I just knew that the chaos was being caused by an alien virus that had crash landed on Earth's North Pole millions of years ago, perhaps hitching a ride on some meteorite.

We were standing in some mutated landscape, where the ground was a bright beige with spots of mottled purple and green. We were trying to reach a safe haven as the world had been mostly mutated by the virus, and we were stepping carefully to avoid hitting some mutated plant that might kill us. At one point we could see over a small ridge that there was a pasture of unmutated grass, with normal looking cows, and we decided that that would be the best course of action. We clambered over the ridge and started heading towards the grass when I noticed this plant in front of us. It was tall like a sunflower, but it looked like the flower hadn't bloomed yet. It was like a cone, and it would shoot these mutated seeds that would stick to wherever they landed, and if they hit us it would make us sick. It fired some seeds in our direction and I could see them approach in slow motion, but just before they made impact, I woke up.\"));\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;","outboundReferences":[],"inboundReferences":[]},"fields":{"slug":"/Dream Journal/2022/03 - Mar/2022-03-05 Resident Evil","title":"Resident Evil"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"ab0b5a9e-c4b5-5f43-a6a9-65f68d540ed2"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2098632890","2221750479","2468095761"]}
