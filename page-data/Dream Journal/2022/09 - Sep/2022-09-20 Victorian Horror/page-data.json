Or at least a part of their family randomly and trying to get them to like me. I was in some house that was like a Victorian era museum, but then it got spooky. One kid, a little boy in a fancy suit, was suspended in air held up by tendrils of hair, and then he dropped a few feet and screamed as I fell through the floor, then looked to my left to see a woman with no face, just shadows. Then a creepy man in a chair that I thought was a statue jump scared me, and then I was lifted into the air by a swarm of bats. I tried to scream in the dream but only a whimper came out and I woke up. I guess I got sleep paralyzed.\")));\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;","outboundReferences":[],"inboundReferences":[]},"fields":{"slug":"/Dream Journal/2022/09 - Sep/2022-09-20 Victorian Horror","title":"Victorian Horror"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"edd8fcc3-ddd4-5caa-a260-1d130f013099"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2098632890","2221750479","2468095761"]}
