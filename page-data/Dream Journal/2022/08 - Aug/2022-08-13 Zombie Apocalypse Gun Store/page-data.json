I was at some language testing center for some reason.

In this dream, Chloe had gotten a second cat, and the other girl said she was also in Berlin and had a cat, so I said I surely must come to Berlin now since I know of 3 cats there.

It seemed easy enough, so I figured I could go do something else and then come back and finish it. I headed outside (I was working from home, so this is now in Seattle I guess), and the streets were full of zombies, Left For Dead style. They weren\\u2019t that hard to deal with, I think I just had some melee weapon and cleared a path.

The owner seemed goofy, like a Borderlands character, and I asked him if he had any full auto shotguns. I was looking for something like an AA-12, but he handed me this long, thin gun that looked like a skinny Gatling gun with a drum magazine. Except instead of neatly stacked bullets, the drum was full of random plastic parts just dumped in there with no ordering. The store owner told me it\\u2019d be best if I collect the shot parts so I could reuse them (I guess this was like a NERF gun). It seemed to be pretty good though, and so I spent some time customizing it.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"I added a holographic scope on the top rail, and somehow attached a pink Care Bear doll to the butt such that when I ADS it would be facing my enemies.

I was then walking up Minor to get home, but a bunch of brightly colored gang cars (like in Saint\\u2019s Row) were going around doing drive bys, I guess there was some sort of gang war going on. They\\u2019d see me and I\\u2019d ADS my gun at them, and I guess the Care Bear doll confused them as they\\u2019d drive away. I also realized at this point I had spent too much time at the gun store and I\\u2019d be late for that task I was given for work earlier, so I started rushing home, but also hoping there\\u2019d be a big group of zombies to test out the new gun on.
