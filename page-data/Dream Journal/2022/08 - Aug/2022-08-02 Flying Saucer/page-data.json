I was on a giant flying saucer, made up of many concentric rings that were rotating in opposing directions (one would be clockwise, the next counterclockwise, etc.). I\\u2019m not sure how many rings there were, just that there were a lot. The smaller rings were higher up, so really the flying saucer looked more like a flying ziggurat.

I ran, ducked, jumped, dodged stuff, climbed and shimmied over things. Yet I didn\\u2019t feel like I was physically doing these actions, it felt more like I was inputting things to an invisible controller (the overhead camera view was all I saw, no hands on a controller), and the movement felt sticky like in Uncharted, i.e. I didn\\u2019t have to try super hard to get the movement I wanted to or land jumps etc.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"At one point there was some floating guy on a cloud, kinda like the dude in Mario Kart that fishes you out when you fall off the edge, except this guy looked like a human and was actively trying to sabotage me. Despite this, I eventually made it to the top, and could see a great view of a city skyline below as the sun set, it was a red-orange sky. At the top layer was a large chamber with a throne and a giant pool. There was a woman sitting on the throne, the presumed queen of this flying saucer, and before I could figure out more, the saucer landed on a helipad of some giant mansion built into a cliffs edge (well on top of the cliff and jutting out and down).\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"A woman who looked just like the queen on the throne came out of the mansion and towards the saucer, and she was taking measurements of the queen to make some clothes.

They used these prosthetic shells that looked like the body part being measured. E.g. for a hand, it was like the skin of a hand but hard like plastic, and it could stretch and stay in the stretched shape (imagine manipulating something in photoshop).

Somehow the tape they were using was mine (at least I had that feeling), and as part of their show they cut the tape and that made me sad, and then I woke up.\"));\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;","outboundReferences":[],"inboundReferences":[]},"fields":{"slug":"/Dream Journal/2022/08 - Aug/2022-08-02 Flying Saucer","title":"Flying Saucer"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"ff22b6e0-fa53-54b3-afd8-e2cffc582305"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2098632890","2221750479","2468095761"]}
