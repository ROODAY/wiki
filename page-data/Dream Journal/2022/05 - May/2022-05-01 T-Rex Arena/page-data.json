The arena floor was sand/dust, and I felt like I was in some sort of post-apocalyptic environment.

I shouted that it wasn't my fault, and that it was unfair to hold me accountable. The view was no longer first person so I could see the container hanging in the air, suspended by a crane, and the son inside the VIP box (it was enclosed room, like in a stadium, so I have no clue how he had a spear that could reach me outside).

I remember standing behind her and putting my hand on her waist, and it felt so real, the warmth of skin and being that physically close to someone else. The brain do be crazy.
