Be a thought leader, encourage others to do the same. Have more engaging discourse by honing your opinions by yourself first, test them out with others

Like an arena of opinions, a debate. We train our opinions like we do champions, Pok√©mon, etc

Writing down thoughts will make them more robust to discussion with others

Some people's are just better, like shiny pokemon says [[Brandon He]].
