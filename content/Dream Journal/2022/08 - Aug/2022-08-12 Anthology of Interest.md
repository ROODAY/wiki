# Anthology of Interest
### 2022-08-12

So this is just a collection of images I remember from what was basically a fever dream. I was on some planet where everyone had these red stones that looked like something out of Dr. Strange, and each person who had these stones was granted one wish. I saw kids running around wishing for stuff like toys, gadgets, snacks, etc. But all these wishes were tearing apart the fabric of reality, and earthquakes were happening and the ground was opening up, pretty much your standard world ending apocalypse.

Then I think I was Spiderman, or some other type of hero who can’t fly, and I was with 3 others, a couple of which could fly. We were in two pairs, and each pair was trying to get out of the current apocalyptic predicament. We used our stones to construct portals to somewhere else, not sure if it was another planet/dimension/reality/etc. But as we were doing this, the ground beneath was breaking up, and at one point we were falling towards a pit of lava (we were somehow high up in the sky now as we had a lot of time before impact). We got our portals created in the nick of time and were able to get through before we smashed into the lava.

I remember a short scene where I was at a skate park with Tony Hawk, and he was teaching me how to ride a skateboard.

The last bit was again just some images, not even coherent scenes. I was in some giant mansion, and I was trying to show someone some website but I kept typing it wrong somehow. The screen would glitch out like in a horror movie, and things just felt wrong, I didn’t see anything but felt like some cosmic horror stuff was going on.

There was a scene where I was in a completely blank space, like a room that went on for infinity but everything was white. There was a floor, but I couldn’t really see walls or a ceiling, they must’ve been too far away, and everything just blended together as white. In front of me was a doorway/portal, and in it I could see another portal connected to it at a 90 degree angle. But it could only be seen when looking into the portal, physically walking behind it showed nothing. It looked like what would happen if you had two mirrors connected by one edge facing each other and you started folding them shut like a book, the image you’d see on the mirrors is similar to what it looked like through the portal.

As I was staring through, I saw some girl but the view became pixelated, and then she reached a hand out and grabbed me, pulled me into her side and jumped into where I was. I’m not sure where I was, cyberspace? Or some other dimension? I just knew I was trapped, and then I woke up.
