# Office Vignette
### 2022-08-02
---

I was at work, but the building interior didn’t look like anything I had seen before. There were fairly tight corridors/hallways, could fit maybe 2 or 3 people abreast, and had really large rooms with floor to ceiling glass walls, tinted a deep blue so you couldn’t really see through them. Inside each of these rooms was a large open office space, and I was in one of these.

I was sitting at a table with some friends, I couldn’t remember who it they were except for Rachel. A senior engineer/manager lady came up and said that they were doing in-person interviews in Beijing and would fly out interviewers, and I said I was very intersted, but Rachel was like “why are you going if you can’t even speak Chinese.” Which was a fair point. I just wanted to try the authentic Chinese food and hoped I could get around well enough.

That’s it for this dream, it was really more of a transition scene between [[2022-08-02 Elite Duel|Elite Duel]] and [[2022-08-02 Flying Saucer|Flying Saucer]].
