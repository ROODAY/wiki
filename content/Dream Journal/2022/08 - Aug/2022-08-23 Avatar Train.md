# Avatar Train
### 2022-08-23

This was the night after I saw Bullet Train, so I think this dream is heavily inspired by it. I was walking through the streets of some city with a young girl, a child, and I was protecting her from some organization that was trying to kill her. Our goal was to get from one side of the country to another, and for some reason the method of transportation we chose was, you guessed it, a train.

The interior of the train was super fancy, like something out of Murder on the Orient Express, but it was even bigger. More like airplane sized. There were bad guys all over the train, Russians I think. They weren’t uniformed though, they were in various plain clothes and disguises, but they all had ear pieces in to communicate with each other, so they didn’t blend in that well.

We were moving from train car to train car, avoiding detection, but eventually there was an area that was too heavily guarded. That’s when we met this older girl, around my age, who was the daughter of the mob boss. She was nice and helped us out by pretending to be the little girl’s sister and let the guards catch her, only for them to be confused when they saw who it was. But this gave us enough time to get past them to the front. Also for some reason I think the mob boss was dressed as the conductor?

Eventually we couldn’t get any further, and that’s where the story takes quite a turn. I became the Avatar, like in A:TLA, and flew outside above the train, and used my Avatar powers to pull it along super fast. I felt like earlier I was in the US, but somehow at some point we were in Korea, and there were soldiers trying to stop the train by caving in a tunnel. But then I just used my Avatar powers to earthbend the rock away.

I’m not sure how the story ended, as I woke up soon after, while in the process of tugging the train along.
