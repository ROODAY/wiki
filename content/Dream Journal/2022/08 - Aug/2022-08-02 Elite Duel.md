# Elite Duel
### 2022-08-02
---

I was part of some research group investigating some ancient ruins in the jungle, and we had some military/mercenary type people. Kinda like Alien or Predator. We were exploring the ruins when but had to retreat as there were some creatures inside we weren’t prepared for (again like Alien or Predator). As we were leaving the ruins, we disabled some auto turrets and carried them with us to setup closer to our base as we were worried of an attack there.

While we were setting up our equipment, I was prepping a turret on one part of the perimeter, and I saw an Elite (like from Halo) coming towards us. I setup the turret in surveillance mode to see if I could get more info, but the Elite saw me and I didn’t have enough time to setup the turret back into shooting mode, and although I shouted for my teammates, they were too far away to help by the time the Elite came bounding over to me.

The fight with the elite only lasted a minute, I kept spraying him with my assault rifle till his shields dropped and he died. He was trying to run away at the last minute, jumping up to the rafters and getting near a window, enabling active camo, but I got him before he could leave. Like in a video game, a bunch of weapons dropped from his corpse and lit up with different colors (like in Borderlands or Halo Infinite). He had more weapons drop than he should’ve been able to carry, so I was paralyzed with choice. I ended up grabbing the active camo and a gravity hammer, then regrouping with the team as they arrived.

At this point we decided it was high time to leave so we looked for an escape vehicle. Under some tarps I found a military jeep with the keys in the ignition (lucky us) so we took that and drove off to safety.
