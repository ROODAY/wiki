# Flying Saucer
### 2022-08-02

So this was really like a fever dream. I was on a giant flying saucer, made up of many concentric rings that were rotating in opposing directions (one would be clockwise, the next counterclockwise, etc.). I’m not sure how many rings there were, just that there were a lot. The smaller rings were higher up, so really the flying saucer looked more like a flying ziggurat. The colors were all white and gold, as if everything was made of clouds or marble. It was very biblical style heaven, or maybe more the hyper exaggerated style of Bayonetta heaven. 

I started out on the widest/lowest ring, and had to make my way to the top. It was a like a video game, the camera was at an 3rd person angle (more like 2.5D), and there were obstacles along the rings I had to avoid. I ran, ducked, jumped, dodged stuff, climbed and shimmied over things. Yet I didn’t feel like I was physically doing these actions, it felt more like I was inputting things to an invisible controller (the overhead camera view was all I saw, no hands on a controller), and the movement felt sticky like in Uncharted, i.e. I didn’t have to try super hard to get the movement I wanted to or land jumps etc.

At one point there was some floating guy on a cloud, kinda like the dude in Mario Kart that fishes you out when you fall off the edge, except this guy looked like a human and was actively trying to sabotage me. Despite this, I eventually made it to the top, and could see a great view of a city skyline below as the sun set, it was a red-orange sky. At the top layer was a large chamber with a throne and a giant pool. There was a woman sitting on the throne, the presumed queen of this flying saucer, and before I could figure out more, the saucer landed on a helipad of some giant mansion built into a cliffs edge (well on top of the cliff and jutting out and down).

A woman who looked just like the queen on the throne came out of the mansion and towards the saucer, and she was taking measurements of the queen to make some clothes. For some reason I wanted to help out, and I tried taking the measurements, but it wasn’t with a standard tape measure like in the real world. They used these prosthetic shells that looked like the body part being measured. E.g. for a hand, it was like the skin of a hand but hard like plastic, and it could stretch and stay in the stretched shape (imagine manipulating something in photoshop). I had to make the prosthetic match the size of the real body part and that would be used for making clothes.

However, I was too slow, and in the time it took for me to do an arm and a leg, the woman pushed me aside to do it herself. Then I was sitting somewhere in an audience as this guy and girl who liked Abercrombie models were using measuring tape and measuring themselves super fast while also posing like run way models. Somehow the tape they were using was mine (at least I had that feeling), and as part of their show they cut the tape and that made me sad, and then I woke up.
