# Zombie Apocalypse Gun Store
### 2022-08-13
---

So the start of this dream actually has nothing to do with zombies. I was at some language testing center for some reason. I saw some people sitting on chairs in a beige office room, and in front of me was a curtain blocking off a darker room with a bunch of people sitting at computers. I think the people waiting outside had just taken a test, me included, and the people in the dark room were the graders.

Strangely, [[Ken Garber]] and Chloe from BU were with me, as was some other girl who I can’t remember. Ken was dressed normally, I was in my suit, and Chloe was in some all white outfit that was kinda like a business suit but not really. I can’t really remember what the other person looked like. In this dream, Chloe had gotten a second cat, and the other girl said she was also in Berlin and had a cat, so I said I surely must come to Berlin now since I know of 3 cats there. I think I also tried peaking past the curtain into the dark room but I was told that was “cheating.”

A bit later I was at work chatting with [[Dmitry]], and I was given some task to do. It seemed easy enough, so I figured I could go do something else and then come back and finish it. I headed outside (I was working from home, so this is now in Seattle I guess), and the streets were full of zombies, Left For Dead style. They weren’t that hard to deal with, I think I just had some melee weapon and cleared a path. There may have been other survivors with me helping to clear out the zombies, but I didn’t recognize anyone.

Eventually I made my way over to a gun store, and I was looking for something new. The owner seemed goofy, like a Borderlands character, and I asked him if he had any full auto shotguns. I was looking for something like an AA-12, but he handed me this long, thin gun that looked like a skinny Gatling gun with a drum magazine. Except instead of neatly stacked bullets, the drum was full of random plastic parts just dumped in there with no ordering. The store owner told me it’d be best if I collect the shot parts so I could reuse them (I guess this was like a NERF gun). It seemed to be pretty good though, and so I spent some time customizing it.

I added a holographic scope on the top rail, and somehow attached a pink Care Bear doll to the butt such that when I ADS it would be facing my enemies. I guess it was used to cushion the butt of the gun? And intimidate my foes too? Anywho, next I needed some shoulder strap so I could carry it more easily when not in use. The store owner showed me some cape with a silly design on it, and I fashioned a shoulder strap out of it and attached to the gun.

At this point I was ready to go, but I was worried I’d lose my hard earned work if I went outside and got merc’d by a zombie. So I brought up a save menu with a HUD out of nowhere, quick saved, and then normal saved just to be sure. Then I headed out.

When I left the store, I was now on Melrose Ave, close to where the Starbucks Reserve is. I was then walking up Minor to get home, but a bunch of brightly colored gang cars (like in Saint’s Row) were going around doing drive bys, I guess there was some sort of gang war going on. They’d see me and I’d ADS my gun at them, and I guess the Care Bear doll confused them as they’d drive away. I also realized at this point I had spent too much time at the gun store and I’d be late for that task I was given for work earlier, so I started rushing home, but also hoping there’d be a big group of zombies to test out the new gun on. But then I woke up, so I guess I’ll never know.
