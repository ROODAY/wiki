# Motorcycle
### 2022-09-13

- I was at some building, can’t tell if it was work or school, I was parking my motorcycle and then told I had to move it, parking was tough to find, and somehow while parking the area turned from a cliffside at sunset to being on a sea ship (like shipping boat) at night in rough waters. I remember walking past some tunnel/machinery and seeing some people and parking my motorcycle.
- Then I think I was having lunch and I was part of same game like in Alice in Borderland, it was like SAW almost too. I got 4 takeout containers of food, but 2 of them had these mechanisms in them that I could tell were traps, so I left those alone (they were the yummiest looking too, sadge). After this “lunch” I was back at the cliffside building and saw [[Luis]] getting in his car to go home, and I said I’d race him back. Apparently motorcycles and cars have different roads in this world.
- I ended up in some desert instead of Seattle, and I think I somehow knew it was San Diego? Instead of [[Luis]] there was some random person on the other side of a canyon from me, and I was saying how a puma could probably jump the distance, and then we saw one do just that. We climbed down to meet in the middle (it was only like 20-30 feet down, not super far), and then I crossed over to the other side. I think there was more but that’s all I can remember.
