# Birthday Party on Steroids
### 2022-09-07

Unfortunately I’m writing this 2 days late and a lot of it has left my mind. I’ll have to do just a bullet list of scenes I can remember.
- I remember being in some sort of giant high-rise on the ocean, maybe it was more like a city on the ocean? But it was one giant tower, like a mega structure. I was with [[Dmitry]] and some other Seattle friends near a lower level, like a couple hundred feet above the water. We were in some sort of suite, it looked pretty nice, and the bois were sitting on the edge with fishing reels trying to catch something. I think they did end up catching some pretty large fish.
- Then I was in another suite, higher up this time, still surrounded by friends. Except I was naked and having sex. The rest of them were just standing about, chatting etc., as if this was a normal thing to do. Then some hotel staff in fancy suits came by and I was on my phone trying to add the current suite to my booking, but the app kept failling and saying I couldn’t. The staff explained taht I had hit my limit of 5 suites and I couldn’t add any more, and I grumbled and they left. Then I turned to my friends and told them how awkward it was to have talked to the staff while I was having sex. I guess talking to friends is normal in this world.
- Then there’s a big tone shift, I’m attending a friends birthday party and it’s at some nightclub that they rented out. I’m in a dark, rainy cyberpunk city, lots of neon lights outside. I enter the club and it’s like a stadium with its seats. Imagine a cube shaped room, darkly lit, mostly black, and there are seats sloping down like a stadium, except facing a corner of the room instead of a side. The inside of this place is massive, like a couple hundred feet in each direction. In the corner that all the seats are facing is a giant screen. As I walk down the aisles of seats, I see a big foam pit so I jump maybe 10 feet down into it, then remember I don’t like foam pits because it’s hard to get out of them.
	- On the giant screen is a multiple choice question, like A B C D, asking something about the birthday girl. It was similar to [[Shashank]]‘s Would Rudy Rather? But the catch here was that instead of just answering what we thought was correct, there were 4 people who each had a letter on them, and we had to grab a piece of foam from the foam pit and chase down the person with the letter we thought was right and tag them (they would try to run away). Seems like a pretty fun variant.
