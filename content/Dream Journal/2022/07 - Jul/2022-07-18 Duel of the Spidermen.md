# Duel of the Spidermen
### 2022-07-18

Yet again writing this like a week after it happened, and I didn’t much info to go off in the first place…

I remember being in an SUV, driving the Sudbury boys around on some trip. That’s really all I can remember from that scene. Then I have an image of being in a bedroom and a cyborg/robot Spiderman who didn’t have legs crawl up on the ceiling of my bedroom. He looked like the cyborgs from Mortal Kombat, and was definitely trying to kill me. The bedroom I was in reminded me of Miles Morales bedroom from Into the Spiderverse.

Then I was in a different scene where we were in a mall I think, so big open area. The cyborg Spiderman was now just a normal guy (with legs too) and we had a dance fight, which turned to be more fun rather than deadly. And that’s pretty much all I got for this one.
