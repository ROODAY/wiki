# Developing Film at the Office
### 2022-01-25
---

Was at the Microsoft campus, and some event had just occurred. I believe it to have been an event for SCIM Squad because Thuy was there. I was in some space that had semi-open/cubicle space, like the part of Studio B where Vernon or Shiva works. 

I had some big roll of film that I think was a recording of the event that just happened, and Thuy had one too. I wanted to take look at her roll of film to see if I could make out the images on the negative, but she told me to stop as the light would ruin the film. After this, I woke up.
