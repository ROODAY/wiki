# Squid Game Costco
### 2022-01-27
---

First thing I can remember was being in a car with my family, we were driving to some Boeing factory/warehouse/campus etc. Somewhere in bumfuck USA, where there's a lot of space. I was peering out the window and saw tall mountains, covered in snow, with what looked like rivers of dirt breaking the bright white. It wasn't actually rivers of dirt, but that's what the streaks of earth between the snow patches looked like. I tried looking up to the top of the mountains, but they passed the cloud cover. There were some domed buildings with catwalks connecting them dotting the mountainside.

After taking a gander at the mountains, we drove to some large store. I thought it was a grocery at first, but in retrospect the large, boxy architecture reminds me of Costco. Akash and Anuthara were there, and I assume the rest of the Malaysian side of the family was too. For some reason I had the feeling we were in Korea, and perhaps that feeling was due to all the Costco employees being dressed as Squid Game characters, both the masked workers and the players in green track suits.

While we we were walking around the Costco, I saw the workers carting some stuff around, not sure what exactly. Recalling this dream at the end day means my mind is filling in some gaps, perhaps not in the way I originally saw it. Now, I want to say they were carting around mannequin parts. Eventually, I saw that they had erected a display full of body painted people, who could just barely tell were real due to almost imperceptible shifts from their breathing. It was like the human furniture of the VIP episode in Squid Game.

Now, that's not the weirdest part. There was a Jesus figure too. In that there was what seemed to be a Caucasian male, dressed up as Jesus, viewing the display from the left side of the room. Except his skin was body painted a bright, shiny gold. When he noticed us gawking at him, he got mad and told us to get lost. Well, soon after that, I woke up.
