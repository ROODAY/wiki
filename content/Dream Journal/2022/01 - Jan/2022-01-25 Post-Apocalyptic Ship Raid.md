# Post-Apocalyptic Ship Raid
### 2022-01-25
---

I was on the deck of some large container ship, near the bow. It was a sunny day, blue skies, maybe some clouds. I don't remember whether the ship was run aground or in the water.

I had some partner with me, he was trying to eat or get his weapon ready or something, the point was he wasn't able to contribute in defending us. Which we needed to do, as this ship was owned by some Big Bad that didn't like us, and so the Big Bad sent his goons to kill us. The goons were like standard terrorist characters from generic shooters mixed with the psychos from Borderlands.

Directly in front of me was a red shipping container with both ends open, my partner was taking some cover by one of the open doors of the container. Goons were streaming in all around and through the container and I was doing my best to hold them off. Eventually some car with a mounted machine gun on top, perhaps modeled off a monster truck but smaller, was sent to deal with us (how this car fit on the ship/got there, I do not know, but this lends credibility to the theory the ship was run aground, but also this was a dream so anything goes).

My partner finally was done with whatever task was holding him up and he assisted in the dispatching of the goons in the vehicle, and we used the car/mounted gun to clean up the rest of the wave.

After this, we entered the control tower/observation deck part of the ship, and somehow our pair became a squad of 4. The ship was quiet on the inside with no enemies to be found, and we were looting the rooms we passed through for equipment. I distinctly remember a room we passed by later that had shelves of dog food and other pet food, and past those shelves were shelves of human snacks like candy bars. Everything was covered in a thin layer of dust, so no one had been there for some time. After we moved through this room, I woke up.
