# Don't Buy Shitty Gifts For Teachers
### 2022-01-31
---

I was back in some school setting, perhaps LS but also could've been a generic High School. Well, actually, before I was in the school setting I had flashes of being at a mall with my parents, picking up some gifts for some teachers and not thinking too much of it, I can't even remember what I ended up getting other than the fact that they were cheap (I have a vague idea that one of the gifts was a Dr. Seuss book). Now we let's get back to the school. 

The teachers that I had bought gifts for were Senora Wilkinson and Senor Abadia, both of whom taught me Spanish, although I had Wilkinson in middle school and Abadia in high school. Regardless, both were royally pissed at the quality of the gifts I had chosen, or perhaps they more upset with the lack of effort in choosing the gifts (this seems like a more teacherly thing to reprimand). I remember Wilkinson reading through the list of gifts from other students and being so happy and grateful at what the others had gotten her, and when she got to me she was super disappointed and angry. The images of Wilkinson and Abadia being upset with me flashed back and forth, almost like I was in two places at once.

While I remember Wilkinson verbalizing her disappointment more, Abadia wanted to exclude me from some class activities, and I remember crying and begging to stay in the class, that I would go get replacement gifts. He seemed to relent and said fine, and I participated in some "activity" where some strange, hairless, flesh-colored alien, akin to the Jockeys of Left 4 Dead, sat on my back while I planked on the floor, and it kept rubbing against me and overall was very uncomfortable. I can't remember if other students had to do this or if it was just me, but I was just trying to focus on the assignment. After it was over, Abadia kicked me out anyway, so in retrospect this seems like some cruel punishment meant just for me.

Despite the cruel and unusual punishment, I kept my word about getting replacement gifts, and got a blanket that looked like a tortilla for Senora Wilkinson and gave Senor Abadia my COD Black Ops RC-XD toy. I don't remember too much after that.
