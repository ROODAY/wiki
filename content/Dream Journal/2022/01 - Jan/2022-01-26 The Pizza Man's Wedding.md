# The Pizza Man's Wedding
### 2022-01-26
---

I was watching some production happen on a stage, although I hesitate to say "I" at first. I think the view was like that of a camera in the beginning, panning from stage left to stage right (looking at the stage from in front and above). Justin Timberlake and Britney Spears were performing some song and dance number. After their performance, everyone quieted down and it seemed to be some sort of wedding ceremony, but for multiple couples at once. I got to witness this from the front row, and I remember being confused and my dad glowering at me for not being respectful, but this only added to my confusion.

After the ceremony, we had a reception in the pizzeria owned by the Pizza Man, and I had helped to make some the pizzas. At least, I remember a guest taking a slice of what looked to be the BBQ flavored pizza from Ian's, and I told him that I hoped he enjoyed it as I helped make it. There was also a homeless man who we invited in to have some food and rest inside. I don't remember much of the reception or of talking to people, but I distinctly remember having to go upstairs and having to pee (the layout of the stairs and bathroom reminded me of the Sudbury home). Promptly after I finished my business, I woke up.
