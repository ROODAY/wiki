# Lake Crossing At Night
### 2022-02-24
---

I was in a horse-drawn cart with someone, but I can't remember who it was. And it wasn't really a cart, it was some object that we were using as a makeshift cart, or rather a sled as there weren't wheels. I think it was something metal, originally I thought a part of car, but the shape reminds me of a PSP, some sort of clamshell design.

The horse took us to a lake, and it was the middle of the night, but the sky was bright and full of stars, and despite the time the feeling I got was that of warmth. The clamshell cart opened up and turned into a sort of raft/boat as the horse pulled us into the lake, and once were in the water the horse disappeared as we started drifting towards the other shore.

As we drifted across the lake, I looked to the sky and saw constellations, one looked like a cactus and another looked like a ten-gallon hat. Not sure why these constellations were wild west themed, but hey it's a dream ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. I don't remember much else, other than an inkling that the person I was with was scared of water, and thus didn't like being in a boat on a lake. I also don't know what was on the other shore we were drifting towards, just that I was enamored with the stars.
