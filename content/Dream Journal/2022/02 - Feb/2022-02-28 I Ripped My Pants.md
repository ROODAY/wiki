# I Ripped My Pants
### 2022-02-28
---

I was on a big stage as part of some large performance. Stage may be underselling it, it was like one of those grand opera houses, or maybe even a concert hall or a stadium. I don't quite remember what the audience seating looked like since it was so dark, but the stage area itself was stepped, higher in the back but only for a few feet before dropping down (it could be some walkway for crew?) and then this middle section extended for a quite a bit before the final drop off. Perhaps that final drop off was the end of the stage and led into the orchestra pit.

I'm not sure what kind of performance it was exactly, but I think it was some sort of dance, or at least some sort of movement piece, although I can't remember any music. What I do remember is that I was wearing my new Tiros that arrived last Friday, and at some point during the performance I did a slide. This is how I got a hole in my last pair of Tiros, although that hole was pretty small and just under the left knee. This time in the dream however, the entire left side of the pants was shredded and torn apart, and I remember being devastated that yet another pair of Tiros had been wasted.

There surely was more before and after this sequence of events, but I can't remember them.
