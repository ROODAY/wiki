# Force Push Through Time
### 2022-02-01
---

After the events of the [[2022-02-01 Hijacked Ship]], I found myself walking along a street outside in some city with my high school friends, and there were also other classmates of mine from high school (so perhaps it was some sort of field trip, and I guess that would make the city Boston). At some point in our walk some old man threw a plastic spoon on the ground near me and told me that it was safe to use and that I should use it. Like any normal person, I did not.

I did however start going around to all my classmates and telling them about this weird old man that threw a spoon near me, and I noticed that he was following me. At first I wasn't upset by his following of me, just that I felt bad that he might be hearing my disparage him. That didn't stop me however. And he continued to follow.

I'm not too sure how the change in setting happened but somehow I was now in a busy hospital corridor, and the old man was still following me, and now I was promptly terrified. He didn't seem to want to hurt me, rather from his facial expression he seemed just as confused as I was about the whole situation. I was running down the corridor now trying to get away from him when eventually I just turned around and pushed my hands out as if to shove him, but he was still a good 10 feet away. Despite this, he flew backwards and veered hard to my left, into and through a door to a room. 

I ran in to check on him (I didn't want to kill this guy after all) and saw that he was in a bed with IVs drips sticking out of his arms, but he was still wearing the same clothes as before (I want to say...dark shirt with a brown leather jacket, and some dark khaki pants, not sure of his shoes). He stood up, with that confused expression still on his face, and pulled out the IV drips and began his chase once more. 

I ran out the room and tripped and fell to the ground, and with the man fast approaching I held up my arms again, basically looking like this:

*minus the lightning*

He stopped moving and lifted up a bit, suspended in the air. There was some date written on a chalkboard behind him, and as my fingers would slightly shake from the strain of using this power, I saw the date rapidly change as the man seemed to be in pain. It was as if the man was a video and my fingers were seeking back and forth through it. I tried bringing the date back to the current day and set him down, but fingers spasmed as I tried to drop him and he disappeared. Then I woke up.
