# Club Disco
### 2022-02-07
---

I was in some sort of club at night, and everything was washed in a dim purple glow. I was in a tuxedo, and I was a spy, and I knew that the name of the place was Club Disco. I sat down at a table to have a drink when I heard my name, and turned to see Jabba the Hutt, who reprimanded me for thinking I could get away with inventing a new gadget without cutting him in on the profits. It seemed that my cover story was a scientist who worked for Jabba.

After talking my way out of a sticky situation with the Hutt, I walked around on the club and met up with a fellow agent, and somehow the club was connected to an airport terminal. As we walked around, I saw some cop with a mangled foot, although he didn't seem to be in much pain, and it seems now that this guy was foreshadowing my own future troubles. Shortly after this encounter, we were made and had to escape the club while armed men chased after us.

I don't remember how I exactly I left the club and got to the next place, but I was now in one of the upper floors of some skyscraper, and I was kitted out in SWAT gear, and I had a partner with me. We cleared out the building, room by room, floor by floor, taking down small pockets of hostiles until eventually we took a small glass elevator down to the second floor landing of a large ballroom.

We walked down the left side of the curved double staircase into the ballroom, and this is where the boss battle happened. Some of the attendees ran away, I assume they were the heads of the operation, and I had to fight some guy who kind of looked like Death Dealer from Shang-Chi.

*This guy, except I don't remember the mask being white or stylized in my dream*

The ninja started throwing throwing stars at me, and I tried to dodge them but a few of them stuck into me. Luckily my SWAT armor protected me somewhat, and I tried taking them out of my vest and throwing them back. But in classic dream fashion, I couldn't aim them properly, or even when it seemed like they should hit, they curved away or fell to the floor just before making impact.

Out of nowhere, my dad appeared, wearing his martial arts instructor uniform, asking what was going on. I mentioned that I was in the middle of a duel, which he accepted and said carry on then.

I'm not sure how this ties into the next scene, but randomly the ninja was no longer a problem and now this girl with a very long dress (think like a bridal train except this dress was more beige colored) tried running from the ballroom and I chased her down and tackled her, I guess she must've been one of the head honchos of the enemy organization. I didn't get to find out though, as then I woke up.
