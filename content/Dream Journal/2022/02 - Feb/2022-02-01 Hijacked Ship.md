# Hijacked Ship
### 2022-02-01
---

I was on a large container ship out at sea with some other guys, not sure who they were exactly but they were friendly. There was some time where I was just wandering around the ship, and I remember someone hiding inside some storage locker and falling out, perhaps we were playing hide and seek? Or maybe this was a stowaway that was the impetus for...

A Hijacking! Some woman and her band of thugs hijacked our ship and marched us down below ship, and we were marched single file down a metal catwalk/corridor. I say corridor as there were walls on either side of us, but they were slanted away at a 45 degree angle, and at regular intervals the wall had openings where we could see large cells/pits below. As we were marched down this corridor, we were pushed off into these pits, one at a time, one person per pit. Eventually it was my turn.

I fell into some greenish sludge, made me think of the sewers, and before I could get up I was attacked by some creature that reminded me of a [rakghoul](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Rakghoul) from KOTOR. Well, I couldn't really tell what it looked like other than it had similar proportions to one of those beasts, and I suddenly could see myself from the third person, and I was this handsome fellow:

*This is a bit of a discontinuity as rakghouls aren't in KOTOR 2, which is where this player-model is from, but hey it's a dream ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯*.

I was wearing the black robes of the dark Jedi and pulled out a red double-bladed lightsaber, which I used to quickly dispatch the rakghoul. I then noticed some larger monstrosity at the far end of the pit, it looked like a Falmer chest from Skyrim, except it was taller than I was and made out of pink flesh and long teeth, with fleshy tendrils whipping about. It kept spawning rakghouls that I fought, until I eventually killed this boss monster as well. It was at this point that the dream shifted into the [[2022-02-01 Force Push Through Time]].
