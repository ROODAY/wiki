# Morbius
### 2022-02-12

This was another dream of vignettes, except this one had a recurring theme, in that Morbius the vampire guy was in all of the scenes. In pretty much every scene, Morbius would be around in his human form, and then somebody would notice, and then he'd eat them.

There was one scene that in some sort of fancy study, imagine an old-timey rich person's study. Morbius was sitting behind a large mahogany desk, sitting in a fancy leather chair. There were 2 people there, and one of them was a psychic. They felt an odd presence and then read Morbius' aura and said that he was full of darkness. Morbius smiled and said that the psychic was correct, and then turned into a vampire and ate both of them.

I also vaguely remember there being another vampire, except this guy was bald and also  good. I remember him being in some American suburb, running through backyards while in his vampire form. Not sure whether he was running from something or towards something. Perhaps he was in a fight with Morbius?
