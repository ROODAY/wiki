# Race Up The Tower
### 2022-02-02
---

I don't remember how I got in this situation, but I seemed to be stuck in sort of level in a video game, where I would start out on some pier with this big, buff, Duke Nukem looking guy walking towards me, [menacingly](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/00/43/85/004385f76965c1727c35e5134bc5fe89.png). Even though I couldn't see a controller, I could imagine myself pressing RB on an Xbox controller and sprinting, running around the guy and up some set of stairs.

The stairs would continue into some sort of tower, but not really a tower. Imagine a map created in Halo forge mode, with floating platforms connected by random stair cases, elevators, and other forms of locomotion. Due to the platforms not having any guard rails, it really was like the parkour maps from Halo, as a slight misstep would cause me to fall to my death.

Well, to my respawn. After each mistake I'd start back from the bottom, with the scary man there as well. At some point during my attempts, I became a horse and could move faster than before, but the scary man also made an equine transformation. Except for some reason I kept getting the vibe that he was more sassy than scary now. Regardless, I never made it to the end, as I'd just keep falling and repeating the level. Eventually, I woke up.
