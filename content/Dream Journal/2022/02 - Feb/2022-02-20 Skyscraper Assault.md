# Skyscraper Assault
### 2022-02-20

Writing this the following day as I didn't have a ton of time yesterday, so the details are a bit fuzzy. Expect some creative writing.

I was flying through the air in a v-formation with 4 others, and we were flying ourselves like Superman. As we were flying, our formation morphed into a plane, with the lead having a cockpit materialize around him while the rest of us turned in the planes wings. It was some sort of modern fighter jet, but shortly after the transformation the plane became a WWI era biplane. Despite this change to an older vehicle, it was flying against the night sky of a modern city scape, towards a massive skyscraper.

As the buliding approached, I noticed there was a long runway jutting out from the building (how this was supported architecturally I have no clue), and the plane tried landing on the runway, but came in too fast. It skipped and skidded down the runway, overshooting it, and going down some other small path through some scaffolding, almost like the run inside the Death Star 2 in Episode VI. 

Eventually the plane ran out of makeshift runway and crashed (albeit slowly since friction did its job of slowing down the craft) into some sort of metal garage door. We hopped out of the plane, and the garage door opened, and a battle began. Out of nowhere we (and I'm saying we although it seemed that the biplane had only 1 occupant, I'm not sure where the rest of us showed up from, me included) were joined by more friendlies, all of us armed with modern guns, and starting the fight.

The interior of the building looked like something out of Saints Row 3, and as I say that I realize the entire dream was probably influienced by that game. The inside had a blue hue from the lights, and there were metal catwalks criss-crossing in front of us while large, sci-fi machinery hummed below. Our enemy agents wore suits, sunglasses, and ear-pieces like agents from the Matrix, and were similarly armed. However, they were also supported by vampires and zombies, or perhaps those were a separate faction. Regardless, we had to kill those too (and this really reminds me of Saints Row).

I'm not sure what the outcome of the battle was, as I must've woke up and went back to sleep, leading to a new dream: [[2022-02-20 Safety First|Safety First]].
