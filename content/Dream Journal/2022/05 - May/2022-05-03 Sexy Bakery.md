# Sexy Bakery

I was in some bakery owned by two women who were just wearing bikinis and chef aprons. There was an initial room that I was in with one of the bakers, connected by a corridor to another room with the other baker. Each room had a circular workstation in the center that was covered in cookies, and on the edges of the walls were all tools and ingredients one would need to make cookies, which the bakers were hard at work making. The cookies that they made were large, gourmet ones, each with a diameter about the length of my hand.

Whenever I walked up close enough to a cookie, I would see some text appear in my vision: "Press RB to gooblegobble". I had no controller, as I guess I was the character in the game, but I could feel RB being pressed somewhere, and I'd pick up a cookie and eat it. I remember them tasting delicious, although I can't remember the exact flavors. After eating 3 or 4 I felt stuffed, despite wanting more (even my dreams won't let me overeat, sadge).

I walked from one of the rooms to the other to talk to the other baker, and as I was walking through the corridor, I noticed that there was a third room off the corridor, filled with more women in bikinis, all enjoying the cookies and having a good time. I think the inside of the room was decorated to look like a beach, as the walls were painted with murals of beach sand and blue skies, and there was very bright lighting. I think I saw pool chairs and umbrellas, etc. It seemed fun.

When I got to the other room, I noticed that there was a film crew, and that they were interviewing the bakers as their bakery was doing very well. I ended up being in the background of some of the shots, but I wasn't the primary focus of the interview. The last thing I remember was opening a closet and checking what was inside (it was just some storage closet/pantry), and then I woke up.
