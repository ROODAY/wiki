# Demon Vegeta

The first dream that I remember in this sequence was me being on some sort of ranch house in a prairie, and I was standing on the second floor balcony that was above the porch. It was sunset, with the blue sky giving way to orange and purple, just a few clouds there. In front of the house, in front of my view, was a single dirt path that lead from the house's front door off into the distance, and the path was flanked by knee high grass, or maybe it was wheat (I don't know, I don't think I've ever seen wheat in person anyways).

Coming down the path towards the house was Vegeta from Dragon Ball, and he looked pissed. I guess he and I had some beef and he was coming here to settle it. When I saw him, I started yelling and went super Saiyan, and my hair floated up like a troll doll, I guess in normal super Saiyan fashion, and I was surrounded by a blazing aura and a beam of light shot up from my head to the heavens. I floated over the balcony, down, and back a bit so that I was standing on the porch. Somehow the beam of light above my head noclipped through the ceiling without damaging it, as the third person view (that's how this whole scene has been) could see the light still reaching up into the sky.

As Vegeta got closer, I suddenly lost my super Saiyan form, it was as if my body was rejecting it. Then, my body seemed to bubble, expanding and contracting as if something inside was trying to get out, and then I turned into some demon form, like Sukuna from Jujutsu Kaisen. it was at this point that Vegeta and I clashed.

I don't actually remember much of the actual battle, just that I was beating Vegeta and he was knocked down. Somehow we were in a different place, there was snow on the ground and a cave, I guess we must've been fighting in the air. Right as I was about to deliver the killing blow, I lost control of my body again and the demon jumped in Vegeta's body. The two tumbled into the nearby cave while I collapsed on the snow, and then Vegeta stepped shortly after, under the demon's influence. It thanked me for making him weak enough to take over, and that now he had a much better host. The demon mentioned that he had to resort to cowardly tactics in the past, such as possessing a child before he got me, but now he had full reign. Then he crouched to prime himself, and jumped into the sky and out of sight.

As I regained my bearings and look around, I realized I was in some large basin of some sort. The area I was in, next to the cave, was under some large overhang, in a way a giant cave, but it was so big and open that it was well lit (I wish I could draw what I see in my head). If you were looking at this area from the other side of the basin, to the right was a large slope that led out of the basin. All 3 other sides of the basin were just cliff faces, so the slope was the only way out. As I exited from underneath the overhang to be under the open sky, I could see up on top of one of the cliff faces was an antenna, and I figured I could use it to relay a message to call for help. I summoned some sort of game crafting menu and made a beacon, but I don't remember planting it/getting out of the basin, as it just switched into the next dream: [[2022-05-03 Sexy Bakery|Sexy Bakery]].
