I was at a house party of some sort. Maybe it was at my apartment, or someone else's, I'm not sure. I do remember that it was high up, so it definitely was an apartment of some sort. The lights in the room were pink, or rather everything had a slight pinkish glow to it. There was music playing and people were mingling, but I can't recall the songs or who the people were. I do remember being on a couch with some girl, I was sitting normally while she was lying sideways with her legs over my lap. It wasn't anything sexual, but definitely more than friendly. Normally that'd be fine, but this girl had a boyfriend (I wasn't it).

I knew in the back of my head that I shouldn't be doing this, but I remember at that point in the dream I didn't want to think about it, and I was just happy being this close to someone. And then suddenly there was a time skip.

It was now a few days into the future, and for some reason she didn't want to talk to me and was doing her best to avoid me. I had no idea what was going on, and my first assumption was that her boyfriend found out and so we couldn't interact anymore. Despite this thought, I wanted to hear it from her, but alas I couldn't get a hold of her.

Eventually someone else, who I presume was a friend in this dreamscape, mentioned that her boyfriend had cheated on her, and now I was confused why she wasn't at least talking to me. I remember walking along a city street pondering this. The street was steep, and I was walking downhill. It was a lot of concrete, not much green, it seemed futuristic somehow. It was also super wide. Actually, now that I think of it, perhaps it was more of a park than a street, as it was too wide to have been for just pedestrians (it was as wide as a park). Strange though that the park had no greenery, just concrete.

Anyways, that's all I can really remember about this. At some point during my walk downhill, I woke up.
