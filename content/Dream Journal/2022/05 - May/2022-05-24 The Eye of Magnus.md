# The Eye of Magnus
### 2022-05-24

This one started out in my apartment, Pano 1702. I was standing on my bed, but I wasn't me. Actual me was still sleeping, while I was a female mage. I think I looked like an adult Ciri from the Witcher, wearing white mage robes. There were elves and humans duking it out in the apartment, but I don't remember there being much noise. Somehow the whole battle was dead silent, which was good I guess, otherwise I would've woken up.

One of the elves came towards me, and at first I thought it was an Elite from Halo, as it's helmet looked very similar. Think of the below helmet, the way it has spiky things coming out the back, but imagine that the spikes are just pointy butterfly wings. That's what this elf was wearing. Also it's stance was similar to that of how elites in Halo held themslelves, which added to the illusion. But I took off the elf's helmet and inspected it, and it was interesting to see the butterfly wings.

I followed the elf out into the living room, where other elves had surrounded the last human. It was a teenage girl named Tulalia (idk why this name, but I remember the elves calling her that). She had this thing in her hands, it was a sphere connected to a metal rod by a metal chain. Maybe 2-3 feet in length total. The sphere had intricate engravings on it, like the Eye of Magnus from Skyrim.

Before Tulalia could do anything with the Eye, the elves incapacitated her, and I took the Eye. I went to the balcony and held it up to the sky, and the sky turned green. All the elves were astonished, and weren't sure whether the magic was that it actually changed the color of the sky, or whether it was just an illusion. Either way they were impressed.

After that, there was a scene where I and some of the elf leaders were chilling on my balcony, discussing what to do next. I don't really remember any of the dialogue, but I do remember that there were two other version of me (the Ciri character), both different ages. The one that I was inhabiting was probably late 20s, and on the balcony was an early 20s and a teenage version. The teenage one stormed off into the apartment for some reason, and I think the early 20s version was making out with some elf. Before I could make any sense of what was going on, I woke up.
