# Another Day At Work
### 2022-05-25
---

I was at the office building a desktop to use for work. For some reason, I had to share the desktop with Rob (we'd each have our own accounts and could use them simultaneously, like a Linux server). Rob installed what looked like a smaller motherboard into the existing motherboard. It jutted out perpendicularly, like a graphics card, and onto the smaller board he installed some stuff like a CPU and RAM, etc. It was like he was adding a computer within the computer.

Then we discussed what would be the best way of cooling this thing since now it was so dense near one side, it would need pretty good airflow. I jokingly suggested we just immerse it in mineral oil to dissipate the heat (which is a real thing btw), but we didn't want to risk making a mess at the office.

Then I walked down to the cafeteria, and there were rows upon rows of free donuts. It was glorious. I ate a few, and then walked back around my desk area. Suddenly I was back at the apartment, and on the kitchen island there seemed to be a bunch of new purchases for the kitchen. We had like 20 copies of the small dishwasher safe cutting board, as well as tons of black plastic spatulas and ladles, also copies of the ones we already had. I wasn't sure why we had so many of these, but before I could find [[Lorne]] or [[Matt]] in my dream and ask, I woke up.
