# T-Rex Arena
### 2022-05-01
---

I was in a square arena. The edges of the arena were made out of metal and rose up maybe 8 or so floors. For some reason it makes me think of the mega apartments from Judge Dredd. The arena floor was sand/dust, and I felt like I was in some sort of post-apocalyptic environment. Despite being an arena, I don't remember hearing any people in the stands/floors etc. watching me, but there was this tower in one corner of the arena that had a VIP viewing box and I know there was family there who was watching me, they were the rulers of this place.

More importantly, there was also a T-Rex in the arena with me. It charged at me and somehow I was able to evade it (this is a dream after all), and I was shouting for the family to put a stop to this and let me go. Next to the base of the viewing tower was a shipping container, and I figured it'd be a safe haven from the T-Rex since it had short, stubby arms. I ran to the corner opposite the shipping container, and I'm not really sure what I did but somehow I distracted the T-Rex with something and  gave myself time to make it to the shipping container.

But when I got to it, it was filled with massive Xbox disc boxes, so I had to frantically toss those out to make space for me as the T-Rex started back towards me. Luckily I was able to get them out in time and shouted at the family in the VIP box to lift the container. They did. However one of them started poking at the container with a spear (and being a dream, this spear was able to pierce the metal of the container as if it were butter, and nearly got me).

The spear wielder was the son in the family, about my age, and he was yelling about how I had killed his brother. I then had a vision of Harry/The Hobgoblin from Spiderman 3 (the Sam Raimi one) getting impaled by his glider, and I guess this made me Spiderman. I shouted that it wasn't my fault, and that it was unfair to hold me accountable. The view was no longer first person so I could see the container hanging in the air, suspended by a crane, and the son inside the VIP box (it was enclosed room, like in a stadium, so I have no clue how he had a spear that could reach me outside). The son was pouting but eventually listened to me.

Then there seemed to be a time skip, and I was with the family now and I guess they were ok with me? The son had a sister, also my age, and she too originally hated me for killing her brother, but eventually she came around and we started hooking up (as one does in a dream). I remember standing behind her and putting my hand on her waist, and it felt so real, the warmth of skin and being that physically close to someone else. The brain do be crazy. I also have an image of a castle on the top of a hill during a stormy night, and I want to say that this scene happened at that location.

Next there was scene that was just a straight up fever dream. I saw my disembodied head floating in the air, with the top of my head missing so that there was hole into my head, but there was no brain/gore etc. just a black void. My head was floating in some sort of foresty swamp, there was a pond below my head with lily pads and frogs, and there were fireflies floating about. It was a pretty serene image.

The girl's head was there too, and across the screen (yes I said screen, it's the only way to make sense of this scene) floated jewels like diamonds and emeralds and rubies. I had the sense that I was playing some sort of video game, and off screen I was holding a phone, as I remember swiping up on the gems to try to make them land in either of the heads (I didn't see this swiping take place, as my entire view was the heads floating/in-game view). I'm not sure what the point of this game was, and how to win/how well I did, as soon after this scene began, I woke up.
