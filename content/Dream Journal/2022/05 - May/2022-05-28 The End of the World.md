# The End of the World
### 2022-05-28

It was the end of the world. Or at least, the days leading up to it. A Galactus-like figure was coming to consume the planet, but we had a few days notice. Rather than everything falling apart to anarchy, people seemed more or less ok with the fact that everything was ending, and just wanted to enjoy their final days.

In this dream, the world was sectioned off into a few areas, each accessible by a train line (each area was a different stop). It was like a video game, in that each area I could wander around freely with contiguous memory, but going to another area would pan the camera out to show the train leaving/entering, and it would fade to black between areas, as if it were loading.

I can't remember exactly what I was doing in this dream, I just remember travelling back and forth a few times between different areas. The shots of the train leaving/entering areas was almost like stop motion. I do remember the end of the dream pretty clearly. I was sitting on some sort of amphitheater, although it was really steep. It was in the middle of some city plaza, like it was sandwiched on both sides by buildings and shops. Think of it like some super steep hill in Seattle or SF, just that the center of the hill was stepped. At the bottom of the hill, the world disappeared.

Instead of the hill flattening out, beneath us was a big blue swirling vortex, and at the center was the giant head of the Galactus figure consuming the earth as it was being pulled away from underneath us. Despite this, we didn't seem to care. There was some girl next to me and I think we were making out, as were most people who were with their partners I presume. A pretty relaxed end to life as we knew it.
