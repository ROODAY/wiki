# Battle on the Pier
### 2022-03-14
---

I was on some pier, in some gloomy/foggy place. I was with a squad of people, and we were on a rescue mission. Up ahead, past a throng of enemies clad in black, I could see my people rigged up in stocks 10 or 15 feet off the ground, completely naked. My group moved forward quietly, trying not to arouse attention, but eventually we had to make a move.

We jumped onto the crowd, and I mean "onto" in a literal sense, as we were running across the crowd by jumping from person to person, stepping on heads and shoulders. Eventually we made it towards the front of the crowd, near the end of the pier, and we began to fight our way forward.

In this dream universe, it seemed there were no weapons, as we all fought each other hand to hand. Some of my group was busy getting our people down from the stocks, while others joined in pressing forward towards the end of the pier where the enemy leader was. Eventually we reached him, but this was when the tide turned.

He and his elite force of 3 or 4 guards were an actual challenge, blocking all my punches and counterattacking swiftly, forcing me to be on the defensive. Slowly we were pushed back, and it was starting to get tense as it didn't seem possible to defeat them. Then I saw his attention move beyond me and he shouted to his soldiers to make sure the prisoners didn't escape. He was particularly worried about 4 Jedi siblings who had a form of [battle meditation](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Battle_meditation), which would have made them very difficult to fight.

Unfortunately, I didn't get to see how this fight played out, as shortly after this I woke up.
