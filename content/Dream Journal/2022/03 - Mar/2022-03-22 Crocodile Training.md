# Crocodile Training
### 2022-03-22
---

I was in some room with some other people and 2 baby crocodiles on the ground, similar size to the one that zookeeper brought to after school when I was 8. We training the crocodiles to be more docile, or at least attempting to. That consisted of trying to hold their mouth shut to assert dominance and instill in them that I was the Alpha Crocodile, but the one I was training wasn't having it.

The other person who was training the other crocodile seemed to be having more success, and the 2 instructors seemed to be happy about it. I can't really remember much else about this scene, other than chasing my crocodile around the room. The room itself was pretty small, like a bedroom. Actually I think it was a bedroom, as there was a bed in the center of the room (weird placement for a bed).

After the training scene, I remember being on some dirt path in the jungle with my parents, and they mentioned they could drop me off back where I locked up my e-bike, but I realized my bike wasn't charged. Then somehow the jungle area became a suburb, like Sudbury, or rather it was a mix of Sudbury and a jungle...a jungle-like suburb...maybe it was reminiscent of some town in S.E. Asia? Also as I wrote this paragraph, I was getting images of some other dream I had in the past, where I was on some gondola with a guide, passing through some flood maze, and we were in the center of the maze, where there was a large open space, and a closed off area in the center. I don't know what was there though.
