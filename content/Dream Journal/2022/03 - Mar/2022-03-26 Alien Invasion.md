# Alien Invasion
### 2022-03-26
---

Writing this the day after so I don't remember too much, but I do remember in the beginning of the dream inquiring about that Ana de Armas movie where she's naked in a bathtub, or perhaps somehow that scene was in this dream? I don't really know, but regardless soon the dream turned into an alien invasion set in 1950s America, somewhere on a ranch in a Midwest prairie.

The aliens were short, gray skinned, big heads and big black eyes, so your classic caricature of a space alien. I think it was sunset at the ranch, golden hour, and everything looked nice and pretty. There was an alien in the living room of the house, and it attacked us, and we shoved a metal pipe through it's chest, and then it just pranced around in pain and we left it and checked upstairs. I'm not sure where we got the pipe from, or how the alien survived with the pipe in its chest.

I don't remember what happened in the upstairs, but afterwards when we came back downstairs, the alien was still there, in pain, with the pipe sticking through its chest. It was actually kind of comical. We left the front door, and the alien resigned to killing itself with a cordless drill to the head (I have no idea where the cordless drill came from, it was a green battery powered one that should not have existed in the 1950s), and after that I woke up.
