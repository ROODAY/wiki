# Anthology of Interest
### 2022-03-13

At the start of the dream I was video calling with my parents and looking at some mountain of dirt, it looked beaten up and perhaps in some sort of warzone. My parents said something to the effect of "why would you buy property here" so I guess I must've bought the plot of land that was the mountain? Regardless, I started to question how we were seeing this feed of the mountain since my parents weren't there, and then the camera panned out to show another person in the call, and it was Cliff uncle.

This version of Cliff uncle had white facepaint with black markings, and it made me think of one of the monsters from the Hellraiser universe. However he still spoke and was pretty jovial, showing us around what seemed to be an active warzone. I could see people on his side lining up next to mounds of dirt/trenches, firing across no man's land (felt very WWI in the setup/scenario of this battle). As Cliff uncle was walking around and talking to us, his back to the enemy, I could see his fellow soldiers getting shot/blown up/otherwise killed in the background and I was amazed that he wasn't even scratched.

In the next vignette, I was sitting on some train, except this train had seats on the floor, the ceiling, and the walls, all with their tops pointing towards the center, so I guess gravity didn't really matter on this train.

I can recall vague images of being in some train station, underground, lots of silver/metal everywhere so it was possibly in the future/some other planet.

There was one scene where I could see out the train window (somehow I could see out the window despite the seats on all sides, or perhaps during this scene the seats were normal?) and I saw an Asian woman in a green coat take and glasses take off her heels and run to catch up with the train at the next stop, which was in front of a large stadium. I remember seeing some bus in between the train and the stadium, and the sky was dark, possibly overcast, during dusk. The woman made it on the train successfully, and in retrospect I think she was the mother from Turning Red.

The final vignette had me joining an indoor trampoline park as an employee. I was in a room with [[Carey]] where the entire floor was a single, giant trampoline, and I talked to her for a bit there. I don't really remember what we talked about, but afterwards I headed towards a door that connected to the rest of the park, and someone who I guess was my boss or the owner of the establishment was welcoming me to the team.

I explained to this person that I actually already knew everyone, implying either that I was regular at the place or that I had worked there before, but I don't know which implication was true. Despite this claim, I apparently didn't remember everyone's name, as I can recall one guy (a shorter, tubby white guy with a mustache, perhaps mid forties? I think I saw gray hair) say hello to me and remember my name, but I couldn't remember his. I had to look up his name on some team roster (it was "Every" something, I'm not sure of the last name, and I'm confused why "Every" and not "Avery").

As I met these people, they streamed into the first room where [[Carey]] was while I went into the larger room that they just left from. There were dodgeballs strewn about the place, so I guess a match must've just concluded. What was weird was that the dodgeballs were of all different sizes, ranging from as big as a basketball to as small as a pea. I have no clue how a pea sized dodgeball can be thrown well, but hey it's a dream. There wasn't anything else as then I woke up, or at least I can't remember anything else.
