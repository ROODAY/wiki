# Submarine Shenanigans
### 2022-03-27
---

The first part of this dream was actually before the submarine, in my exhausted stupor I dreamed that I was awake in my bedroom and really thirsty, but busy doing something else. I can't remember what I was doing, but I was putting off taking a sip of water until I finished, and then I guess my throat punished me by constricting and getting super dry, and I thought I was going to die, but then I was able to gulp down a swig of water just in time, and then that scene ended and this dream began.

I was on a tour of a military submarine, learning how it worked (similar to the Smarter Every Day videos where Destin was learning about submarines). However the interior of the submarine looked nothing like a normal submarine, it was massive. Granted, I didn't see the exterior of the submarine so perhaps it was just a massive ship, but this isn't the first time my dreamscapes were non-Euclidean geometries.

In some areas the interior looked like the Titanic, with red carpets and beautiful double staircases that curved down to the next level, but in other areas it looked more like a proper submarine, with metal panels and pipes jutting around. At some point my group snuck off from the tour and went to the lowest level of the submarine, and it truly was massive down there.

We entered into a large open space, almost like there was an entire warehouse, but instead of shelves/crates filling the space, there was sand everywhere. The room was like a big box, and straight ahead and near the top of the room I could see a catwalk with door leading out of the room. The sand all over the floor made me think of the bottom of the ocean, except there was no water filling this room as it was still inside the submarine.

There were soldiers patrolling about, but I guess for some reason they didn't recognize us as tourists? Perhaps we had stolen some uniforms, although I don't remember this happening, perhaps in this dreamland uniforms aren't what identified the soldiers. There were strings of yarn all over the floor, a few inches off the sand, and I knew that they were tripwires of some sort, and that if we tripped them, then our cover would be blown. However the strands of yarn were truly *everywhere*, crisscrossing all over and generally just being very hard to step between.

Eventually we made our way around to the edge of the room, and I could see another person carefully avoiding the yarns just like us, whereas the soldiers were walking around calmly as if the yarns weren't even there, so I assumed that this person also wasn't supposed to be down here. Eventually we came upon a corner of the room that looked like the interior of some domestic kitchen, and there was a man and a woman there, presumably the parents of the guy who was ahead of us, and he was going back to this room to meet up with them. I'm not sure what happened with this characters next, as the scene skipped abruptly.

I was in some bunk room of the submarine with a guy and we had sex, which in retrospect was strange as I don't swing that way, but during this scene of the dream I don't recall being into it or not into it, it was just happening and I was observing from a third person view. Afterwards, another guy and a girl walked in, and supposedly more were on the way, and there was going to be some orgy, but it was at this point that my dream-self drew the line and remembered that I have a girlfriend, so I let them do their thing and left the room. That's when the dream transitioned to [[2022-03-27 The Witch's Manor|The Witch's Manor]].
