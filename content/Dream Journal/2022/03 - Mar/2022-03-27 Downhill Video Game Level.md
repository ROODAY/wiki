# Downhill Video Game Level
### 2022-03-27

After the witch from the previous dream ([[2022-03-27 The Witch's Manor|The Witch's Manor]]) kicked me out of it, I found myself running downhill, avoiding obstacles that I had to either duck under or jump over. The problem was that the camera was facing me, so backwards, so I couldn't see the obstacles coming. It was daylight, and I was running down a road, and to the left was a wall where the obstacles were attached. The color palette was mostly white, with starkly contrasting colors, almost like Mirror's Edge.

Regarding the camera issue, eventually I realized I could will the camera to turn around, but if I lost focus it would snap back to facing me, like Rocket League. And if I hit an obstacle, I'd start again at the top and have to redo it. I found myself jumping a lot just hoping that spamming jump would work, and quickly ducking as a reaction when needed. Eventually this worked and I got through this section of the level so to speak, but then there was another part.

Next I was barreling down some deserted highway, with empty trucks and cars littering the road, and I had to dodge these vehicles. I also turned into some sort of dune buggy, or perhaps it appeared around my body, and had to avoid the vehicles while in my own, although I did end up crashing a few times and the level continued without restarting. I guess my car gave me extra health? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

All the vehicles didn't look like real ones, they looked more round and futuristic, like the Proteus or Scarab from Rocket League, mixed with the aesthetic of Red Faction: Guerilla. Perhaps I was on Mars, or some futuristic earth.

Eventually I made it past this deserted highway zone too, and approached some town. There was a big building with roads on both sides, with big trucks on the right road, parked alongside the building, and further to the right there was a monorail raised off the ground, with monorail trains going by every now and then. Despite not seeing any people walking about, I had the feeling that they were in the building in the center, and in the monorail.

As I approached the town/building, my car kept crashing into things, and after crashing I would reset to approaching the town, only to crash into things again. Whenever I did crash into things, voxels would fly out, so maybe things were held together like in Space Engineers. First I crashed into the monorail, somehow my car could climb up the pillars and onto the track. Next I crashed into the trucks that were parked by the building, they were big and blue with cylindrical backs, like fuel trucks, but there were no fuel-powered explosions when I crashed. And then, abruptly, the dream ended, and I woke up.
