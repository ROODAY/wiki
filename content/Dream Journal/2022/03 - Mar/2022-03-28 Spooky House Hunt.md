- dream, long country road, parents buying new home. We checking out homes along the way, everyone is empty multi family units with curtains instead of walls separating units. We look at lots of them, and keep going down the road looking for more and its the same, starts to get spooky/sense of dread that it's like this. We take a break a on side of road, nothing but single lane road as far as the eye can see for miles. Sometimes we see cars pass by but I never see who's in it. Feels ominous.  
- in later homes once I realize it's the same as. Before I grab everything asap and book it out of there, feeling like somethings gonna happen.  
- eventually parents find new home that's good, at the end of road, hours down.  
- townsfolk add a checkpoint on the road with spikes so that they can raise them if needed to keep out bad folks/whatever else (I have a feeling this gate is for supernatural things)  
- I get to new house and there's a house warming party, I'm in backyard and turn on large fire to warm myself but wind blows the heat the opposite side I'm standing. I try telling someone I had a dream (the searching for houses part, I guess that was a previous dream?) and they don't really care, I try telling Dmitry who's there, but don't have time  
- I'm alone in the house, not sure where others are. Emma and some other cat are there and I try to play with them but they're not interested. I wake up
