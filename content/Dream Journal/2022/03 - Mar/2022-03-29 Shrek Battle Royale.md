# Shrek Battle Royale
### 2022-03-29
---

I was hanging out with Shrek, and I was some talking animal. I assumed at first I was a donkey like in the movie, but I'm not so sure if I was a donkey (my form kept changing though). At first we were in some wooden shack at night, presumably this was Shrek's home. Next we were in a sunny field full of tall grass, similar to the sunflower scene from the movie. Except now I was some sort of racoon like creature, running around and lurking in the tall grass. I remember being annoyed with Shrek and wanting to leave him behind, but couldn't for some reason.

After continuing through the tall grass for a while, we came across a dirt path that ran alongside the edge of the grass field. There were people walking along the path, dressed in medieval garb, which makes sense I guess. We followed the path down for a while, and eventually it was nighttime again, and we came upon a circus with a big tent.

We entered the tent, and there was a fight about to go down, with people in the stands spectating. This is also similar to the fight scene in the movie, except this was in a circus tent lit by torchlight, and all the battle participants had a shackle attached to one of their legs, connected to one of the tent posts by a chain. Now I was a bat instead of a raccoon, and when the battle began I took to the air to attack people from above. Unfortunately this is when I woke up, so I don't remember how the battle played out.
