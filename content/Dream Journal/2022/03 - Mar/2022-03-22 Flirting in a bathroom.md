# Flirting in a bathroom
### 2022-03-22

I really had to pee, and there was a nearby ice cream shop, so I went to use their bathroom. I think it was one of those places where you have to buy something to use the bathroom, but the line for the cashier was massive, and there was already a line forming for the bathroom, so I just hopped in line and hopped that no one would notice.

When I was getting close to the bathroom, an old man who I think was the owner of the shop, came up to me and others in the line and said that it was ok that we didn't buy anything up front, we could just pay $3 to use the bathroom. In the dream I wasn't that irked by this, but writing this out, I'd probably be pissed (see what I did there) if I had to pay for a bathroom in this situation.

Right before I was about to go in, Luis cut in front of me (not sure what he was doing in this dream). After he was done, I entered and the bathroom interior was massive compared to what you'd expect an ice cream shop bathroom to be. It was probably the size of my living room, including the kitchen area (square foot wise) and had really high ceilings, maybe 15 feet? It was a dark gray color scheme inside, with a sink/mirror immediately to the right when you enter, and two toilets facing each other on the far wall, on opposite sides. There were no stalls.

As I went to pee, I noticed some girl sneak in as the door closed, and for some reason my thought was to try and flirt with her, asking something to effect of whether she was trying to sneak a peak. She said something about it being a dumb line, and I admitted that it was pretty hard to flirt while peeing, which my awake self concurs with. Not sure how the rest of that conversation panned out, as shortly after that I woke up.
