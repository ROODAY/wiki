# Duel & Dinner
### 2022-04-15

*Writing this way after the fact, so this is more creative writing than a proper dream journal entry*

I was outside with a bunch of friends, and [[Dmitry]] was there. It was a bright, sunny day, with lots of vibrant green grass everywhere. I guess we must have been at a part of sorts. I think we walked around for a while, until suddenly I was in a duel with [[Dmitry]]. We each had a sword and shield, but they looked like something out of a kindergarten play, i.e. they were made out of cardboard.

I think this was a friendly duel, as I don't remember being bloodlusted, and I don't think [[Dmitry]] was either. I can't actually remember the details of the duel itself too well other than it happened. It may have been in some sort of clearing in the park, I remember it being circular. Or perhaps our friends just encircled us to watch. Regardless, it seemed to be pretty uneventful.

After the duel, we were all getting dinner, still at the park. We were sitting at some sort of long picnic table with a white cloth over it, it was long enough for the whole group to sit down (I think there were at least 10 of us). The sun was setting and overall the scene was very a e s t h e t i c. The best part though, was that right in front of me was a Steak and Ale pot pie from Pop Pie. It was delicious. There was also some girl sitting on my left that I didn't recognize, and writing this a few days late I don't remember any identifying features, but I do remember she put her head on my shoulder and I remember it feeling very pleasant, like warmth spreading out from the point of contact.

Pleasant, I think is a good word to describe this scene, or even dream, as a whole. But alas it didn't last too long, because shortly after that I woke up.
