Unfortunately I'm writing this a couple days late so most of it has faded. But what I do remember is being at work, and one of my coworkers saying that they're going to be in trouble because they pushed some bad code that broke some critical system. I think I told them not to worry about it and we'll take a look, and then there's some hazy parts. I remember being in an underground parking garage inside a car and talking to two security guards. I think that in this scenario, any code pushed to this system requires an audit, and if it's bad, it should've been rejected. One of these guards was apparently supposed to do that rejection, but he said that he saw that the author was Indian and assumed they knew what they were doing and accepted it. The other guard was like "dude wtf," and I think the scenario ended up being ok as they were able to just revert.

I also have a vague image in my head of being in some sort of discotheque and there were a bunch of dudes dancing on the dance floor (which was a grid of LED squares that kept changing color) and all the dudes had fun suits, like Oppo Suits.
