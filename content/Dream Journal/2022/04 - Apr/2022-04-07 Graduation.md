# Graduation
### 2022-04-07

So the first part of this dream has nothing to do with the graduation. I was at some party, which I think was in my Seattle apartment, and people were hanging out and talking. [[Chis]] was there on the couch talking to some people, and the DJ was playing some of his own music and dancing by the TV.

Then suddenly I was at the office and it was another MDO morale event, and I remember eating a ton of food, like pizza, cookies, and cake. The hallways in the dream were smaller than they are in real life, which was strange. The funny part though was that I wrote down what I ate in my food diary in my dream, so I guess that habit has stuck pretty well.

Then I was somehow walking down Comm Ave back at BU, and this guy on the street bumped into me by accident, but neither of us were upset, we just laughed it off and kept walking. I entered this oddly shaped building, I'm not really sure how to describe the shape so I'll just drop a shitty shape from Paint: ![[Weirdly Shaped Building from Dream.png]]

That's a top down view by the way. The door to enter the building is on the left side of that shape, where the angled wall meets with the wall going straight down. I should've just drawn the door location but I'm too lazy to change it.

Anyways, inside the building was a few tables, one of them had a friend from BU so I sat down and talked to her, and then I noticed that at another table was a girl I was into back in college, so I went to go talk to her. Note, she definitely was *not* into me, so I'm not sure what dream me was doing here. But here in the dream she seemed to be interested in the conversation, and I asked what had changed since she wasn't into me before, and she mentioned that she'd have more words for me later, and then got up and left.

*Now*, we get to the graduation part. In that same building, up the stairs to the second floor. The area with tables had a really high ceiling, and the stairs were along the back wall, and went up to a small hallway type deal with double doors leading into a gym/stadium area on the other side. Kind of like place above the GSU, but connected to a stadium I guess.

There were a bunch of people in green caps and gowns, but I had forgotten mine, and instead was wearing my St. Patrick's day Oppo Suit. I also saw one of my coworkers walk past in a gold cap and gown, I guess there was another cohort and the colors were green and gold. I asked the ceremony officiator if I could stand in my suit with the rest of the people, but he said no. ðŸ˜¢

I sat with the audience, of which there were very little, most of the seats in the stadium were empty (reminiscent of my graduation in Oct 2021). I was sitting next to a guy I recognized as a friend of the DJ from the beginning of the dream, and he had a really slick, futuristic looking camera that he was taking photos of the ceremony with, and I told him it was really cool. And...then I woke up.
