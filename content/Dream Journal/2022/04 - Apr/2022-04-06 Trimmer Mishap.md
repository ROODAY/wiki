# Trimmer Mishap
### 2022-04-06
---

I was on some vacation with my parents and friends, and I we were in some big hotel room/apartment place getting ready. Everyone else got ready before I finished, and I was in the bathroom trimming my beard when somehow my hand slipped and shaved a big chunk of hair off, right down to the scalp. I was so distraught that it looked so ugly, I figured the only way to fix it was to shave off everything.

I took the trimmer and went at my hair, but it seemed to barely work, I'd go over the same spot over and over and only little bits of hair would come out, and when I did eventually get to the scalp I'd end up nicking my skin and it would hurt and bleed. When I got most of the hair on the front of the scalp shaved and I looked pretty bald, I realized I still had half of my hair all on the back of my head.

At this point, the others left without me to go on whatever excursion it was, while I was crying and shaving away in the bathroom. I carried on, and eventually I was almost done, when the batteries in the trimmer died and I was left with patches of hair of varying lengths stuck to my scalp. I remember feeling resigned to looking ugly and stepping out of the bathroom, as everyone else was coming back from wherever it is they went, smiling and laughing and clearly having had a good time, while I was miserable. The next thing I know I woke up, and boy was it one of the most relieving things ever to realize my hair was still there.
