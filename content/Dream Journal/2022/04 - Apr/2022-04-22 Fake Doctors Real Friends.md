# Fake Doctors Real Friends
### 2022-04-22

The dream started out on a beach at sunset. It was pretty gorgeous, the sky was orange and purple, the sun was just starting to touch the super clear water, and the sand was a night bright tan and comfy. It felt like somewhere in the Caribbean. I was sitting at a dinner table on the sand, pretty close to the water, with Zach Braff, Donald Faison, and Judy Reyes. They were all much older, with lots of wrinkles, but still good friends as they were laughing and having a good time at dinner. They didn't interact with me much, I was just observing, almost like they didn't know I was there, but this didn't bother me, I was just happy to be there. The guys were wearing Hawaiian shirts and shorts, I think Zach had a flower necklace. I don't remember what Judy was wearing.

After we finished eating, someone who in the dream I recognized as friend but can't remember now, came to bus our table, but I didn't want them to do it alone so I helped out.

Next I remember being on a cruise ship's deck at night, and the stars were out and it was beautiful. I was sitting down at a table, with some guy I didn't know to my right and the railing/edge of the deck to my left so I could look out into the ocean. In the table in front of me where the Scrubs cast chatting and having fun. At some point the guy next to me and I struck up a conversation, and he mentioned wanting to create some sort of app that would take a picture as input and then generate some output using ML (I can't remember what the output was supposed to be). I was then explaining to him how ML works and I remember in the dream trying to explain matrix math, but now that I'm awake I feel like I was just talking out of my ass. ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Regardless, I woke up pretty soon after that, before we could finish our conversation.
