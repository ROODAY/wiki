- in a pelican on the ocean with Carey and 2 others, land near a city in shallow water. Walk towards this iron gate to get to dungeons, but small and medium crocodiles infest the waters. We have stuns guns that zap the wayer near us but somehow not us. Eventually make it to gate and slam it shut Hold it down. There's another door up ahead, so we have to open it, fight what's in it, then have the people holding the first run up through second door, shut it and repeat a few times. Also walking thru the water is super slow. Once we're safe, one of the girls says she has to bounce and goes back the way we came through a shortcut. Carey and I go thru too to make sure she's safe, but then we have to get back and it's tough. Then this giant metal monster, imagine the shrike but with a Warhammer sized body, runs up to us and starts doing hadoukens made of air
