# Crocodile Infested Waters
### 2022-06-21
---

I was in a Pelican (the ship from Halo), with [[Carey]] and 2 other people (I can't remember who they were). We landed in some shallow water on the outskirts of some city. Not sure what city it was, but I do remember an elevated highway/bridge that went above us and towards the city. I didn't hear any cars, or saw much activity from the city, so perhaps it was abandoned and this was some post-apocalyptic setting.

Anywho, we hopped out of the Pelican and started walking towards this building. It seemed to be isolated/not connected to anything else, so perhaps it led down into some bunker area/dungeon area. It was tough to walk in the water, when I said shallow I meant relative to other bodies of water, it was about waist high. This wouldn't have been too big of a problem if not for the fact that the water was infested with crocodiles. They all seemed to be juveniles as they were about the size of large dogs, but still large enough to fuck us up if they got us, so we hauled ass to the building.

However, wading through waist high water wasn't fast enough to outrun the crocodiles (in retrospect I'm not sure why we didn't just swim). But we were able to fight back as we all had stun guns that we used on the surrounding water, and somehow it wouldn't affect us, just the crocodiles. We slowly made our way to the gate, zapping the water all along the way to stun the crocs that got too close, and we slammed the gate shut to keep the crocs from following us in. A little further into the building was another door, and upon opening it there was something we had to fight (I can't recall exactly what it it was), but we weren't able to beat it, so we'd have to distract it, run past it to the next door, and trap it in it's room. We had to repeat this process a few times as each door led to some other monster.

Eventually we were safe, and then one of the other 2, some girl, said she had to bounce and get back to Pelican (no idea why). But she knew a shortcut so that we wouldn't have to fight all those things again (why didn't she tell us this the first time?!). [[Carey]] and I went with her to make sure she got back to the Pelican safely, and we saw her take off. But then we had to make the trek back to the building. At least this time we didn't have to worry about the crocs since we knew the stun guns would work to keep us safe, but we had a new problem to deal with.

When we turned back towards the building, we saw a giant metal monster standing further off to the side (the building was between us and the monster, but it seemed unlikely we'd get to the door before it did). The monster looked like the shrike from [[Hyperion]], but chunkier, imagine the proportions of people from the Warhammer 40k universe. We tried making our way to the building, but it ran towards us, easily cutting through the water we were having so much difficulty with. When it was about 10 feet away, it stopped, and did a hadouken like gesture at us, sending a giant ball of air that impacted us and woke me up.
