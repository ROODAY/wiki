# Pusheenicorn At The Gun Range
### 2022-06-05
---

- was wearing pusheenicorn onesie
- wanted to get a gun and learn how to use it to defend from crazy alt right like Paul suggested
- Except i was being taught how to shoot by the crazy republicans so i had to blend in
- there were girl scouts there who were also shotting and republicans and were sus of me
- then i was transported by some interdimensional portal to a rail shooter like mission, we were moving some payload down a street while it was being attacked, but i dont remember who was attacking it. I think during this sequence i was an elite, me in pusheenicorn, and some giant beetle like thing. quite the fever dream
- I think there were other sections of the dream but i can't remember them
- the gun range part was sunny blue skies, the payload on the street was like dusk, or at least dark sky due to lots of smoke, red from fires, warzone area
