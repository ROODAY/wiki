# Pusheenicorn At The Gun Range
### 2022-06-05
---

It was a sunny day and I was going to a gun range while dressed in my pusheenicorn onesie. As context, I was following the advice of a friend who said that we should all get guns and learn how to use them safely, to defend ourselves from the nutjobs because gun control won't stop them from getting guns (I don't actually agree with this IRL, but dream me seemed to go along with it). The twist was that I was going with a group of said nutjobs, in my dream they were far right Republicans, and I had to pretend to be one of them so as not to blow cover. Apparently wearing a pusheenicorn onesie is ok with them. ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

The gun range itself reminded me of a squash court for some reason. It was outdoors, no roof, just really high white walls that separated the lanes. I don't remember what I was shooting, but I do remember that there were girl scouts at the range selling cookies, as well as shooting guns too. I think they found me suspicious, and because of this so did the rest of the group I was with. Before anything could happen though, a tear in space time ripped open in front of me and I was transported to another world, although I guess in this context it was just a transition into another dream.

In this second half of the dream, I was in an alien city that was in the middle of a war. Rather than the sunny blue skies of the first part, it was dusk, or at least there was so much smoke in the air it felt like dust. The smoke had a hazy red glow from all the fires burning throughout the city. I was part of a squad that was moving a payload down the street, like in TF2 or Overwatch, except the street was straight, and I couldn't tell who the enemies were. Laser blasts were just coming in from all directions from the smoke, but I wasn't getting hurt. My form kept changing, from being actually me in the onesie, to being an Elite from Halo, to being a giant beetle/centipede like thing (this last form wasn't capable of holding any weapons, but it was able to tank shots and protect my squad).

This was more of a picture than a proper dream, as I don't remember much else than the images of me in different forms around the payload. I can't remember making significant progress moving it, nor did I know what the destination was as we never got there. I vaguely remember that there were other parts to this dream, but I couldn't recall them when I woke up, and I definitely can't now as I write this.
