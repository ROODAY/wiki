# Anthology of Interest

I was on some sort of island chain in the pacific, and it was the middle of the night. The water looked more black than blue, the sky was full of stars and the moon was full and bright. Oh, and Predators, like the aliens, were hunting me. I was running between the islands through shallow water (so I guess it was more like one big island that was partially flooded), and the Predators would come up from below and attack me, and I'd somehow slap a sticky bomb on them and wriggle free so I could detonate them. I guess they must've been unblooded scrubs since I was dispatching them so handily. But eventually I ran out of bombs, and I called in to someone asking for more. I guess they were like a handler, so maybe I was a spy? Didn't get the chance to find out before the next dream.

I was in a theater, like for a play, and I was part of the production. I don't remember what the play was, this dream started as it was ending, and the cast was all on stage bowing. One of the cast, some girl, was completely naked for some reason. Then the scene switched suddenly and the same theater was now a movie theater, and I was sitting in the audience watching some black and white Soviet film come on. No idea how I knew it was Soviet, I just did.

It was some sort of detective noir animated film. It began with some girl on the run approaching some building, then it changed scenes to a detective in his office, face obscured by the shadows of his window blinds, just like in a noir. Except this detective was a steampunk robot. His name was Nic Nickelson, and now that I was getting a close of him, I thought that the art style was like [Grim Fandango](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grim_Fandango), which is funny that I think that because I never played that game, and now that I look it up I don't think it matches what I saw in my dream exactly, but close enough.

The detective had some sort of pet/sidekick thing that was made of gears, and was tracking the location of the girl. Unfortunately this is all I got from this dream, as then it changed again.

This wasn't even a full dream, more a series of images. I guess since it was the last one before I woke up from restless sleep I must've been pretty awake for this one. There was some image of train, a really long passenger one, but I don't remember anything else about it. There was also a chase scene on a highway, where the people in the chase were jumping between the roofs of cars. No idea how they didn't get knocked over from the wind considering the cars were going highway speeds. Now that I think of it, perhaps this is related to the previous dream, maybe the chase was between the robocop and the girl from the movie? Oh well, this is all I got for it. Then I woke up.
