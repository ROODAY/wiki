- dream movie crew filming something in this canyon thing. Girl with a machine gun Killing some monster. We have to go down this pit and there's some abandoned facility down there, so we plan first. Im the camera guy, director and I butt heads. I don't think it's safe, there are some shark/piranha things down there we can see (top down view of pit shows them). Also mini gun has 8 barrels and moves like a jackhammer, called a thumper. The plan was to lower the necesaery crew and actors, film the scene, and use some automated pulley thing to pull them back up quickly. I think it's too unsafe. Some of us go down first to scope it out. The walls are all brown sedimentary rock, grand canyon style. The pit is enclosed in a glass wall and full of water, but somehow I was outside the glass wall down there. There were some metal stairs and catwalks going around the glass wall, part of the facility I guess. There was an area connected to this that I walked to, there was some inlet/river that connected to outside, perhaps a sea, also had a glass wall. There were some seals that got bodied by the shark things. Then the scene repeated but instead of sharks it was giant humanoid looking things, but had shark heads. They started throwing the seals against the glass and it started to crack, so I started running back, I saw a crack in the big glass wall with water and then though of how would I be able to swim up faster than the shark things, but I woke up  
- predator movie scene, water islands and planting mines on the aliens, they'd rise out of the water. I was calling someone to get more mines or supplies or something  
- movie theater/Nirmal theater, I was in cast, we were Bowing, one person was naked. Afterwards we saw movie in same theater, it was some animated soviet movie about this girl on the run, and this robot cop. Except he was more steam punk and gears, and animation was like grim fandango. He had a robot gear thing sidekick that was tracking the location of the girl in his office. Robot cop was named nick nickelson. His office scene was like a noir movie, with the heavy shadows  
- something with a train. A chase scene with cars jumping from roof of one car to another

actually a few dreams in here, but the last few were just visions. maybe an anthology can go here
