- im spiderman
- someone impersonates me and disparages me so i cant wear the suit, have to be low key
- have a friend who knows and helps out with missions
- carey is still gf, she's a reporter
- she's doing a piece on a crook named johnny long con
- i show up at the guys apartment building and carey is gone, i get the sense that he captured her
- i start to get ready but then another reporter comes by and recognizes im spiderman but doesnt see my face
- i face away and start changing into my heart suit while answering his question and my friend helps. eventually the reporter leaves
- i call out to the window and tell johnny im a fan of his, he lets us in to discuss crime
- i have a pipe/stick in my hand to knock him out
- he shows another room where carey is tied up, he brings her to the main room
- i motion for her to be quiet while i get ready to strike
- the puts some stuff on the ground and starts coloring and then i wake up
- the whole time i didn't do any spiderman stuff, i just knew i was him
