- running around hi-tech future city area
- me and some others get caught
- are forced to build a nuke for the government or else they'll kill our families
- the nuke is aimed at North of Boston, the government is trying to conserve resources or something so they're killing our own
- they force me to press the launch
- tell parents they have to leave now, get out of the state
- they don't listen and stay where they are, we get caught in nuclear winter
- have to break our way out of the ice, sneak around a military ship to supplies and get out
- travel around in attempts to get back at the government
