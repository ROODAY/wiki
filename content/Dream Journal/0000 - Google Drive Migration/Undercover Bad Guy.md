-   Night time, fancy mansions/estate in tropical area
-   Think castro’s palace in black ops, lots of stone structures
-   Had a FAMAS, kept fiddling with it waiting for opportunity
-   At a table with bad guy leader and two other guards
-   Everyone wearing body armor so I needed headshots
-   There was a gate of sorts to my right, and the truck to the left (think soldier transport from most games)
-   Positioned myself to take out guard and main baddie in one shot, then take out other guy. Kept going over scenario in my head to make sure I could get out, because guards through gate would hear and come through
-   Was upset I didn’t have a silencer as this complicated things
-   Eventually did it as planned, two at once then the other, then ran to the truck as enemies streamed in
