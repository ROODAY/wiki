- small town
- strange things going on that everyone ignores
- seeing things like ghosts
- even during day time see ghost face in tree roots on ground that matches a ghost walking around in the side room 
- we're at a house party where people keep arriving, late at night.
- I keep seeing weird shit but people tell me I'm mistaken
- like seeing faces in windows
- see little shed thing outside
- try talking to little kid who I think can see the things too but can't get anything out of her 
- eventually shit culminates in things everyone can see
- two little kids from drag a body near the shed into the shed.
- some weird figure is creepy walking into another house
- table randomly gets super hot and boils water
- I freak out and wake up
