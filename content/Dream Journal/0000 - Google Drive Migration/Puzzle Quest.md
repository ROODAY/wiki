- we find this book that has some keys in it and a smaller book inside
- smaller book has slots for many keys
- also has small clues for challenges
- have to get all the keys and fill the book
- travel everywhere to do so, others are racing with us
- group includes small kid, nightshade lady, rich dishonored looking man, and Danny rand
- lots of stuff happen in the middle
- eventually get to space station with nukes
- for some reason have to nuke Georgia
- find an ai on the stations that's on our side, hack into the system and lock out the station people
- fire the nuke
- doing so ruptures the command area and we don't have suits
- we hold onto this glass part and hit a button and it forms a pressurized capsule, parachutes down to ground
- land near Japan
