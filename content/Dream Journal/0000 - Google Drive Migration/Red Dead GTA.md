- wake up in room in apartment building with aryeh and lee
- some guy in corner with gun watching us
- I have to kill him, I have a knife
- but he wakes up before I have a chance
- he toys with us with his knife, like pressing it to our necks etc
- when he's doing it to Lee I try to strike but he shakes me off
- I grab his gun and he says if I fire ill wake up everyone including the boss
- I fire anyways then jump out the window into the lake below, swim to the shore and fast travel away
- while walking I come across Buffalo, I shoot at them to hunt them/get some meat and pelts to sell
- the boss from earlier shows up with 2 henchmen saying its time to duel all 3
- but one of his men is actually one of mine
- we keep backing up against a fence and step through to a different set, there's a white van and a RPG on the ground
- I pick it up and we make short work of the boss and his guy
- now I'm a gang leader in the modern world, infiltrating a fbi building
- one of the ladies they trust is one of my people
- I just go around Sabotaging their stuff
