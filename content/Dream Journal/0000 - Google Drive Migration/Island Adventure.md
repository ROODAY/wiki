Island with totem, God/monster returns and says to follow, go to its lair, find gold and riches etc while its at a desk setting something up, it says go near, then it knocks me out. Wake up in dark area, look to right where pregnant wife is held captive, they (monster and two minions) kill her and her I black out again, wake up to third person view, robot is viewing my memories with some blue thing and some woman I know came to rescue, they get me out, i became dishonored like assassin, start off with killing some giant beetles and mech walkers
