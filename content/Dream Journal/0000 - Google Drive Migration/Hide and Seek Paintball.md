- hide and seek/paintball game where people have holograms
- hiding/lying on floor and shooting through cracks in the wall
- eventually its down to me and one other
- it's Andy Samberg
- find each other but we don't have ammo
- tackle each other, both notice paint balls on ground
- each grab one and load and fire at same time, so it's a tie
- after that a separate scene of being in an area and shooting zombies
- but the zombies can be normal?
