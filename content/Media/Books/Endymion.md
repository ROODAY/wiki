Sequel to [[The Fall of Hyperion]].

- Seems to be like [[The Fall of Hyperion]], in that it's a single narrative, unlike the multiple stories of [[Hyperion]]. It's also in first person, which I don't think the previous book was in, although I might be mistaken.
- The first scene with the hunters and Raul's dog dying was pretty gripping.
- The writing style of this book feels a lot different, it feels more movie like in it's pacing, which isn't a bad thing, I find that it's more gripping. Not to say that the previous books weren't, or maybe this is just a big change from [[Slaughterhouse 5]] and the nature of an epic story feels more gripping than meta-fiction.
- I think Simmons does a really good job of referencing characters and plot from the previous books without it being too heavy-handed or detracting from the current book. It's like what the sequel trilogy for Star Wars should've been like but failed at. [[Endymion]] gives enough clues for you to figure out the reference yourself and then when you get inevitably validated it feels really good. I'm excited to see where this goes.
	- In a way it reminds me of how KOTOR 2 references plot from the first game.
