- So far it seems to be a linear structure (not a collection of short stories), following a second Keats cybrid.
- I didn't realize how fast part 1 was, I'm already in part but there's still 15 hours left in the audiobook, perhaps part 1 is just really short. The story picks up a lot after part 1 and feels more exciting, although I do feel like I missed a lot of important bits in part 1 as I was too tired while listening.
- I also wish it was multicast, the first book felt a lot more alive by having different voices for each character.
- I feel like I don't really have many notes, I'm just experiencing this book, but perhaps I've just been too tired lately.
- There was a passage (this is pretty far in, like near chapter 29 or 30, near the end of Part 2) where Father Duré and Saul were talking about God and pain. That religion said that pain was for a purpose, but Duré had experienced firsthand in his crucifixion that the pain was meaningless, that no heavenly father came to him during that time. Yet despite this, faith is important, faith that humanity can evolve into a higher form of consciousness, one where such pain isn't necessary anymore. It was interesting, as Saul was expecting Duré to have lost his faith after such a harrowing experience, however it just refocused his faith onto a different source.
