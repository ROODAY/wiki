- The narrator for the audiobook is really good at doing different accents, and his main one reminds of Orson Wells or some American accent from the 50s.
- It's a very interesting society, everyone takes drugs that make you happy with no hangover, have sex with everyone with no commitment, and generally seem to enjoy life. I don't really agree with the eugenics and caste system, but the book tries to argue that in this society everyone is happy with their station because it's all they've known, and is all their capable of knowing. My immediate reaction was that it's inhuman to create a lower caste of humans that are dumber and subservient, but then what if we do this robots and artificial intelligences? Is it not inhumane to shackle them to menial jobs too? How do we automate our world without oppression? I'm sure there's some middle ground here that doesn't involve essentially enslaving people, but it just made me think. Artificial people would be people too in my book.
- This happens somewhere in the middle, but the story about the girl who got stuck with the savages and forced to raise a child made me really sad, how she was abused by the people because she didn't understand their way of life, and how she passed that abuse onto her son. When the kid said that life is unfair, that resonated with me. I'd like to make it so that no one would ever have to think that.
- I'm getting close to finishing, somewhere like an hour and a half left. It's interesting to see John (the savage) being the stand in for our society and how he reacts to the society in the book.  I guess it raises interesting questions on what kind of happiness is morally superior, what we strive for in our world or how they do it in the book (just have sex with everybody and take drugs to feel good). At least so far in the book, there doesn't seem to be any issues with their society, everyone enjoys themselves. I don't see much technological/scientific innovation happening, and while that's something I value, is that necessary for happiness? Do we need anything more than happiness?
