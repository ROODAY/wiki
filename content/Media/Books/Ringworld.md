- I like how the alien's psychologies are reflected in their culture/architecture/technology etc. E.g. the puppeteers are super scared and cautious of everything, so they have super advanced technology so they can't be killed, and wipe out anyone that could be a threat to them. But then they also have buildings and objects with no hard edges because they're afraid of getting hurt, and don't trust spaceships and instead chose to move their whole planet. The Kzin on the other hand are super aggro and fight stupidly, to the point that their population is 1/6th of what it once was, and the surviving members are more diplomatic because those are the ones that survived and had kids.
- I feel like there's a lot of casual misogyny, or at least stuff that didn't age very well in this book. Overall the story is cool and I like the ideas, just stuff like how Louis treats Teela feels off at times, or in general how women are referenced.
