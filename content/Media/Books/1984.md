I realized I haven't written anything in here and I'm almost done with the book. Woops.

- The main thing that I takeaway is just how insane the Party is. Why do they want power? What's the point of power for power's sake? The concept of doublethink is just so infuriating, yet scary that this is essentially what totalitarian regimes do.
- I wonder if I find it hard to write things down for books like this and [[Brave New World]] because the themes are just so commonplace now. Books like these laid the foundation for the genre, so perhaps everything just seems old to me since I've seen it before. Or perhaps listening to it as an audiobook prevents more critical understanding. Hmm...
