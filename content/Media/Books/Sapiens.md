- The first few chapters of the book didn't feel particularly mind-blowing, most of it felt like common sense stuff about evolution, or rather things just made sense intuitively, although I'll grant that I myself didn't think of these ideas so there's value in hearing/reading them presented in this format.
- This is a few chapters into the book, but it was talking about the luxury trap, the idea that technology was intended to make things easier and give us more time, but we just ramp up the pace. E.g. back in the letter era, people would send a few letters a month, and take a lot of time with them and not worry about getting immediate responses, but with email, we get dozens of them in a day, and people expect immediate responses. I feel like this affects me a lot.
- There was a part of the book that mentions when humans first started domesticating animals as cattle, and honestly it was hard to hear. Stuff like cutting off pigs noses or eyes so they couldn't leave is disgusting, and I know factory farming is even worse. I really wish we had lab grown meat so that I could enjoy the taste without any of the suffering.
