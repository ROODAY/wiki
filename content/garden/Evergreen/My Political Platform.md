Using this doc to keep track of ideas I want to campaign on when I eventually run for Seattle City Council. It's very WIP currently.

## Human Rights
Some things that should be rights: stable shelter, sufficient food to be healthy, access to information/education (internet, schools, etc.). I also think there should be a hierarchy of rights, i.e. some are more important than others. E.g. someone's right to life supersedes your right to autonomy, so you can't hurt people just because you want to.
