Define what exactly a resource is, is it time/labor/materials? or just energy?
- is money really bad? think of manna resource credits, that's the same thing. I.e. it may not be inherently bad, it's just a tool that can be used for good or bad.
- Is trade/exchange inherently bad?
- Scarcity vs. thought of scarcity/artificial scarcity as promoted by media
	- what if we already have enough resources for everyone, and it's only the distribution of resources that is bad
	- Is wanting more at the cost of others the root problem?
- Is more/unlimited resources always better than less? Is this a form of hedonic adaptation itself? Then [[How Do We Solve Hedonic Adaptation]]?
- Do the idea of western individualism vs. eastern communalism relate to this?
