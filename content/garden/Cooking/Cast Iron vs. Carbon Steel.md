- Carbon steel is lighter so better for saut√©ing, anything where you maneuver the pan a lot
- Carbon steel heats up/cools down faster and more evenly
- Cast iron retains heat better/longer (therefore takes longer to heat up), can be put in an oven

I think verdict here is that I want to use a cast iron until I find a good reason or need for carbon steel
