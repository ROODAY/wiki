- start on a school bus
- stop at place that looks like somewhere in Europe, kinda like the csgo Italy map
- it's night time but the streets are lit with neon lights and paint on the ground
- we all get out and follow to the end, there's a giant palace on the waterfront
- tech together is happening inside the palace
- Aaron is in a toga playing the piano by the waters edge
- i realize I forgot my bag and run back through the streets and get it
- as I walk back I feel scared, hunted
- locale changes
- I'm being hunted by Billy Russo
- sometimes I'm also Spiderman and Russo is Venom
- I'm walking along a street and wearing military gear and blending in
- Russo is in a another building and spots me, tells soldiers to aim between my armor where a scar shaped like a spider is
- I notice this and tighten the armor to cover it but I still get shot
- I duck and limp away as Russo comes down
- I web sling away and Russo does the same as Venon in chase
- I make my way to some small house, 2 parents and 3 kids
- I hide out there, they're nice and let me hide
- I tell them about being in the military, there was some private who took a nade earlier on
- Russo finds the place and finds me, drags me with him to a hospital
- shows me the private who took a nade, he's missing limbs and brain function is that of a kids
- Russo says its my fault and I wake up
