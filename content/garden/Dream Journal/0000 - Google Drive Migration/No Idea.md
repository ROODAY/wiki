- fight with two dudes on road, get full of crossbow
- accept it but get scared of losing Carey
- go to hospital get patched up
- do parasailing with the guys but have to be careful due to my injuries
- far future I'm leader of a group trying to survive post apocalypse
- we're deciding where to go, pick a tower that's fortified
- two stages, courtyard and main area
- both are closed off
- sometimes the courtyard gets some monkeys (aggressive and trying to attack) inside and we have peeps with guns to get rid of them
- sometimes the system reboots and the doors between courtyard and main open
- this happens
- alpha monkey gorilla (all white hair) gets in and beats me up a bit
- then it talks, says it's willing to truce
- I tell shooters to hold their fire
- one of our scientist doctors inspects the monkey, it can speak Russian and is able to use the equipment in the medical room (the equipment accepts commands in Russian)
- turns out monkeys used to be human, are just evolved past that
