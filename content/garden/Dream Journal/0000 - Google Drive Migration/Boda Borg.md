-   traveling with 2 others to boda Borg, stop at some place for the night 
-   some random person comes by/we let them in
-   one of us offers to roll them a joint and they start walking to get the stuff and the Rando pulls a knife on him and two other dudes with guns show up 
-   Then I see a bunch of random visions that were kinda disturbing, only one I can remember clearly is someone crawling through a set of bars and as they do so everything turns into flames and disappears 
-   then it turns into a deathmatch game, our captors force us to play, basically back and forth attack and defense, but you start on the same side (defenders have to run ahead and set up) 
-   Felt like r6 siege, had equipment and things to set up 
-   After that was on a spaceship, traveling towards another planet. Far future, we were evolved humans, had cybernetic tails 
-   Some new dude was on the ship, older gruff voice. For some reason I didn't really trust him but everyone else did, he was suspicious, never saw under his helmet 
-   Landed on some planet with ancient ruins, make a settlement and try to research the ruins 
-   settlement on top of hill, ruins around, there was a river nearby 
-   lots of green, Grass etc, also brown Rock formations, like grand canyon color 
-   One of our scientists discover some artifact that can grant different powers 
-   scientist calls me over, as she does so she teleports away, I'm teleported to some boat 
-   boat is racing down waterway, I have other powers, I use one to telepathically move boat so it doesn't hit a wall
-   I then fling my arm trying to do it again but then it speeds me forward in time thousands of years in place, I know because the settlement was on a hill and I saw it turn to ruins
-   I swing my arms back and forth a while scrubbing through time until I found my right spot 
-   Then there was a random section where I was visiting a grandma and grandpa, they were "mine" but I guess I wasn't me, these people were white 
-   Was about to leave with grandma somewhere and I go to the bathroom, somehow discover she cheated on grandpa, I come out of bathroom and now she's young/my age and some other girl is there with her 
-   I confront her and she and friend just laugh, I take the car and leave by myself, speeding
-   end up in some attic, now coordinating a war effort through a bunch of screens, I can see all the past dreams (the defense/attack, the spaceship people, and some new stuff that were misc battles) 
-   I tell my guys were the enemies are and at first we're winning, taking them by surprise 
-   but the enemies quickly rally and wipe out our troops, I start to see it from the front line instead of the monitors
