- dating a person
- big thing that everyone is going to, some fun place
- teleporter pads send people to destinations
- but you need Id to pass
- at one end of airport is the place to go, but remember leaving jacket with wallet on other end
- run all the way across, but no jacket so no wallet
- everyone leaves and trip happens without me
- look around, try to find jacket, who took it
- someone says someone else took it, follow that lead, etc, nothing comes up
- all throughout the girl I'm dating keeps wanting to do things but I say I can't because I need to find wallet, she says I never have time etc etc
- eventually she says she had it, sold it, and leaves and I'm like wut
- I think girl was Chloe?
