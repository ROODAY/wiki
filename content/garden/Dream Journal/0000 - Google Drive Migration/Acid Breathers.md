- a world where some people have the ability to breath acid as an attack
- starts at same gaming event in a sports stadium
- guard is talking to some guy that’s trying to get in, some other guy comes up behind him and breathes on him, leaving an acid burn
- i also have this power but i'm a good guy, there are a few others like me fighting the bad acid breathers
- goes to fight scene inside parking garage/some area with spiral stairs in the back (circular room)
- big enemy dude, buff, takes off shirt and starts swinging a big pipe around
- me and ally eventually get fight him back and knock him down, I look back at enemy and know he has bandolier of throwing knives
- starts lazily throwing them at me and they’re all perfect throws
- i try throwing them back but i suck at throwing, he just throws the back since they land blunt end first on him
