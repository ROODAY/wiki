- me and one other in a zombies map
- small industrial area, corridor like, a prison
- door on left and right, mounted gun in center
- demon Lady with mouth for face comes out of ground to say the horde is coming
- zombies start streaming from the hole in the ground, the sides, etc
- play out like cod zombies
- mini boss comes in form of giant robot
- peaks eye through doors and we have to shoot eye until he leaves and goes to other side
- final phase he gets into the main corridor and starts shooting laser beams (like breath of the wild)
- after defeating him his body disappears and drops some items
- audiologs reveal he was built by a previous warden of the prison
