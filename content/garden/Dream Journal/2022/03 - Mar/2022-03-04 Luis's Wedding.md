# Luis's Wedding
### 2022-03-04
---

I was with Luis and a few other people, perhaps [[Shashank]]? We were walking/running along some mountain trail, the trail was quite narrow and the mountain dropped off steeply to the sides. The sky was clear with only a few clouds, and it was the middle of the day so quite sunny and scenic. I can't remember much of the terrain below, perhaps we were above the cloud cover.

We were running towards a Salt & Straw, doing some exercise to earn the ice cream. Along the way, there was some way station (I don't remember this part too well but I remember there being some sort of submarine type hatch with a valve/wheel handle for the lock). At this station, I met some girl who shared a lot of interests with me and we hit it off, and there seemed to be some mutual attraction. I brought her along with us on the run to Salt & Straw, but I don't remember being at the ice cream store.

Later, we were in some city, perhaps NYC, in a house betwixt apartments/brownstones/etc. We were prepping for Luis's wedding, which was later that day, although we were being quite laissez faire about it. I knew that I needed to shower and change into a suit and tie, but I kept forgetting to/procrastinating (I remember even being in the shower, fully clothed, with the water off and just staring out the window).

Eventually, the ceremony was happening and I had to miss it because I wasn't changed. Afterwards, during the reception, the photographer was trying to take photos of Luis and the bride (I don't really remember seeing her face, perhaps because I haven't interacted with his girlfriend much IRL) and I kept having to move out of the way because I wasn't properly dressed (I was wearing some joggers and purple t-shirt). This continued for some time, and I think the girl from earlier made an appearance, but I don't remember too much else as I woke up soon after.
