# Late For A Flight
### 2022-02-24
---

I was in some large airport walking around with [[Dmitry]], and the airport was connected to some giant mall. I wanted to say it was an outdoor mall, but I vaguely remember a massive interior with a lot of escalators, like the mall at the end of the first L4D2 campaign, but bigger. However, there were open air parts of the mall that connected to nature.

At one of these open air spots, I asked [[Dmitry]] to take some photos of me while I posed in front of some shrubbery and the night sky, until I realized I was going to miss my flight. I must've bolted to the gate because I don't remember the journey there, I just appeared.

Rather than a typical gate/walkway to the plane, it was just a normal door, as if the plane was an extension of the airport. The passageway from the airport to the plane was cluttered with boxes and luggage, and I could somehow see around the corner despite not having crossed it yet, and it was tight and cramped, like a school bus. [[Shashank]] exited the plane, presumably to make room for me/to let me in? A stewardess moved some boxes out of the way so I could enter. I think I entered the plane, but I don't remember much as then the dream turned into a [[2022-02-24 Lake Crossing At Night|Lake Crossing At Night]].

As I was writing this out, I was getting vague memories of previous dreams I've had, but before I started writing them down. I remember being in a giant mall at nighttime, with huge ceilings, and I was going from department to department looking for something. I remember passing through a Victoria's Secret or some lingerie store. Now I'm remembering another dream where I was in a parking structure. Two dreams actually, separately involving being in a parking structure. And both had hitmen? They're starting to blur together.

There was another one I remember being on a plane. I see a scene where most of the color palette is white/bright, and a woman sitting on a bench along the wall to the left, in a narrow corridor. I don't see any windows, perhaps this is in some larger ship, a space ship? It seems too clean and bright for a modern airplane.
