# Berserker
### 2022-02-15
---

I was in the Gears of War universe, which I can tell due to the way the camera was (third person) and how I was sprinting (just like how the sprint works in GoW). There were enemies with guns that were shooting at me, but they looked more like cartoony goblins than Locust, but there was a true blue berserker chasing after me.

The environment I was in looked like it could be a GoW map, it reminded me of Italy from CS:GO. The streets were a lightly colored cobblestone, and the architecture was fancy, Greco-Roman almost. I was sprinting down the alleyways, dodging enemes with guns and obstacles while running from the berserker. I was going on a slight downhill, towards the waterfront, and it was nighttime.

Eventually I got close to the water and had to make a hard right, and I was inside some sort of transit station? Idk why I say transit station, for some reason I'm thinking Grand Central Station in NYC. Regardless, after entering I took another hard right and start working my uphill, but now inside this building and running up some stairs. Looking up, I could see a glass dome letting in the moonlight.

As I kept running, I realized I had grenades in my inventory (which when I accessed the GoW inventory menu appeared before me), and the grenades looked just like they did in GoW, and I could stick them to the floor/walls as mines, just like in GoW. I was hoping to use these mines to kill the berserker, or at least damage it.

Eventually I made it out of the building and into some courtyard, but this was different. It was no longer in the same location, it was daylight, the way I entered the courtyard was through some cave at the base of some cliff face, and the courtyard was a big circle full of grass. There was a wrought iron fence surrounding the circle, and somehow I found myself on the outside of this circle. I could see MI Ken from NEMAC practicing shirtless in the center of the courtyard with some weapon, I think they were nunchuks but I'm not sure. Shortly after this scene, my dream transitioned to [[2022-02-15 Food Truck|Food Truck]].
