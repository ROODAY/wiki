# Food Truck
### 2022-02-15
---

I was the owner of some building on the corner of a street in a city, although I'm not sure what the nature of the building was, or what city it was. Perhaps it was a pub, or some sort of club house? Regardless, I was hosting some event for the people there where we had a food truck with yummy meats.

The line for the food truck wrapped around the building and into the back alley. There was a part of the the alley that was a bit higher, like a second area I guess, that had a black chain link fence, and behind the fence there were some boilers/moisture farmer things from Star Wars. Not exactly sure what they were.

The owners of the food truck offered me samples of the food so that I didn't have to wait in line, but I refused as I didn't want to cut the line. Other than that, I was just chatting with the people at the event/in line/etc. I can't remember too much else, and then I woke up.
