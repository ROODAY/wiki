# Skyrim Demon Slayer
### 2022-02-27
---

I was a demon slayer, wearing the whole shebang. I was in some sort of corridor, but it was also outside, think like a night market deal with stalls on either side and some canvas/tarp roof to shelter from rain. Red lanterns lit up the corridor/street, and in front of me was [[Carey]] as a demon, completely naked. I quickly slashed with my sword and took her down, but with a superficial cut to her leg to snap her out of her frenzy, and as she fell over to her side, facing me, an old woman walked out from behind a stall further down behind [[Carey]]. I told her not to worry as the demon has been dealt with (otherwise she would've called for more help and [[Carey]] would've actually been killed). As I was speaking, the camera panned down to peek just about [[Carey]]'s thigh, showing a glowing wound from the blade, with darkly colored veins emanating outwards.

After this, [[Carey]] and I were walking through the forest, trying to get away from the townspeople and get to safety. We stopped on the path briefly to kiss and I caressed her body, and then told her the priority was finding her some clothes so she could blend in (she was still completely naked at this time).

We travelled down the forest path until we came across a sort of campsite, except instead of a normal camper, it was a guy in jeans and hoodie, sitting at a table playing Skyrim on his laptop. I saw the loading screen on his laptop, and the next thing I saw was the camera view from inside the game.

His character was about to fight a dragon priest, and the player informed me that he was doing some DLC questline that costed $1.50. I saw his character interact with some stone pillar and he was transported inside some Dwemer dungeon, and in front of him was presumably the dragon priest. But instead of looking like the rest of the dragon priests, it was some giant figure (but not a Skyrim giant), sitting cross legged in the center of the room. I saw the game menu come up and he quick saved before continuing.

The room was circular, with a boxy entranceway where his character stood. The dragon priest was sitting cross legged facing the left wall, and in the entrance way to the right was a chest filled with loot and mini word-wall. The walls were stone with gold/brass detailing, with the almost fluorescent looking lamps that are common in Dwemer architecture.

Before the fight could begin however, the camera switched back to my view in the real world, except it was no longer in a forest, but inside some hotel room. The room was mostly red, with red carpets and red walls, I think even the bed had red sheets and comforters. All varying shades though, so it looked pretty nice. [[Carey]] had clothes on, and I heard a knock at the door, followed by [[Lorne]] and Aaron entering. And then, I woke up.
