# Temple Takedown
### 2022-02-08

I was in some ancient temple in a jungle, think like the ziggurats you'd find in South America. I was there with a squad, and we were armed with modern guns, and we were scoping out the inner sanctum of the temple from a hidden viewpoint high up (the inside of the temple, at least in this section, was a large, open atrium). We peeked through little slits in the wall and could see enemies posted in various locations around the atrium, also armed.

One of my squad mates, a Lara Croft looking girl with a big sniper rifle (I guess a cross between Lara and [Yoko Littner](https://gurrenlagann.fandom.com/wiki/Yoko_Littner)) fired at one of the enemies and began the gunfight. I don't remember the fight much, but I remember the framing of the shot (camera wise) when she took the shot (gun wise). It was very anime-esque, with the camera looking up at her from the floor, maybe 3-4 feet away, her taking up the majority of the left side of the view with the gun pointing diagonally to the bottom right.

At some point, we're all out on this outcropping of sorts, or I guess some sort of platform that jutted out from our room, with a drop to the atrium below. We were shooting at enemies on all sides, and then I (it didn't look like me but I had a feeling it was me) ran to the edge of the platform and raise my right arm, and there was some device mounted on my wrist, like a smaller, beige Megaman gun, and I fired a red laser pulse that sent me flying backwards into my squad, and knocking us all back into the room.

This immediately cut to the next scene where we were all crammed into some sort of tube in the center of the room, with glass trapping us in. Kind of like a big vacuum tube, but there was air inside. A viscous red substance began dripping down the outside of the tube, obscuring our view but we could notice a few enemies with facemasks saunter into the room. I don't think the substance was blood because it was too bright, almost like the same color as the laser pulse. And then I woke up.
