# Mob Spawner
### 2022-02-17

I was in a jungle like area, imagine looking down from high above the ground, with some small mountains/hills immediately to the right, tapering down to flatter ground farther out, and dense jungle trees to the left. There were hostile animals (tigers, lions, etc. imagine Skyrim animals) as well as monsters (I can't remember exactly what they looked like but I had the feeling there were monsters), and they kept spawning in.

There was a large truck, imagine the wide load trucks with big cranes/ladders on top except this one was white. Instead of a crane or ladder on top, it had an array of radar dishes and antennas, and I had the feeling that it was some sort of research vehicle and it was causing the hostile mobs to spawn.

I was a giant, or the environment and everything in it was toy sized. Suddenly there was a tank, so I picked it up and pointed the cannon at the research truck and fired at it. I could see a cannon now appear on top of the truck and it was pointing at me, but it never fired, or at least I don't remember taking damage or dodging. When my first hit landed on the truck, a health bar appeared in the bottom of my vision, so I kept firing the tank to deplete the truck's health.

Eventually, when the health bar was depleted, I shrunk to a size such that the environment was sized appropriately, and I ran up to the truck and interacted with it. A settings menu came up before me (imagine the holographic inventory menus of Borderlands) and I disabled the mob spawners and cleaned up the environment of NPCs (like in GMod), and I set a password on the truck so that no one else could use it to spawn enemies.

Instead of a alphanumeric password or a PIN, the password was simply a game title chosen among a library of games. I could see their cover arts, and upon picking a game, 4 images from that game would show up, I presume this was the password but I didn't need to remember it as I never got the change to input it again. I chose some Irish game, the cover art had a lot of green and leprechauns riding rainbows into pots of gold, but I don't remember the name of the game.

After setting the password, I suddenly found myself in a house party with the Sudbury boys, and we were eating food (I think pizza) and drinking beers. The last thing I remember before I woke up was Noah approaching me with a beer in his hand.
