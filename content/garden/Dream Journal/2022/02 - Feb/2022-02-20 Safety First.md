# Safety First
### 2022-02-21
---

I was at an indoor gun range with some friends, and I was shooting a standard glock at some paper targets. I wanted to use something more interesting, like in H3VR, like an extended mag, or a bigger gun. But when I went to the counter and asked for such, I was told I needed to go through extensive safety training, a multi-day affair, before I would be allowed to use them, and I found this frustrating and went back to my friends dejected.

Reflecting on this as I write this, it would be nice if this is how the real world worked. Or perhaps it does already? I'm not sure, I just know that the US could user more restrictive gun laws.
